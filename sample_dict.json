Soon after Tuesday\u2019s ruling about his 2018 salary package \u2014 worth about $51 billion at current stock prices \u2014 Musk put up a\u00a0poll on X asking if Tesla (TSLA) should move its registration from Delaware to Texas, where it is already headquartered. Hours later, the Tesla CEO wrote that the \u201cpublic vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas.\u201d The poll results showed Texas\u00a0had won the backing of more than 87% of about 1.1 million votes. Musk added he will now \u201cimmediately\u201d seek shareholder approval to incorporate the electric carmaker in the southern state. Delaware is famously one of the world\u2019s most welcoming places for companies of all kinds and sizes to incorporate for legal and tax purposes. Nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated there. It is seen as a desirable place to seek approval for mergers and litigate disputes, and doesn\u2019t levy sales tax or tax on profits from intellectual property. While Musk has not commented directly on the judgment on his pay package, he tweeted\u00a0Tuesday: \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d \u201cI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,\u201d he said in another\u00a0tweet. Attorneys for the Tesla shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the company\u2019s directors were too close to Musk to protect their interests. The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received as part of the package are worth $51 billion today, when calculated using Tuesday\u2019s closing price, less the modest exercise price of $23.34 a share. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench\u00a0trial that concluded in November 2022, ruled Tuesday\u00a0that Musk and the Tesla board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d\",\"source\":\"CNN\",\"date\":\"2024-02-01T10:13:00.000Z\",\"props\":{\"title\":\"Elon Musk says Tesla shareholders will vote \u2018immediately\u2019 on quitting Delaware for Texas | CNN Business\",\"image\":\"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1845882546.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill\",\"type\":\"article\",\"url\":\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/business/elon-musk-delaware-texas-hnk-intl/index.html\",\"site_name\":\"CNN\"},\"language\":\"EN\",\"created_at\":\"2024-02-01T15:54:11.043Z\",\"hostname\":\"cnn.com\",\"id\":\"1a7915bfe1ca366d1287ff4df0031dee\"},{\"_score\":16.975752,\"title\":\"Elon Musk To Move Tesla to Texas\",\"link\":\"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-move-tesla-texas-incorporation-1865897\",\"description\":\"The billionaire CEO announced the electric car company would be incorporated in the Lone Start State following an online poll.\",\"body\":\"Electric car company Tesla will begin the process of transferring where it is legally registered to Texas following an online poll, its CEO Elon Musk has announced.The company had been incorporated in Delaware, but on Wednesday, Musk asked users on X, formerly Twitter&mdash;a platform he also owns&mdash;whether it should transfer to the Lone Star State. A resounding 87.1 percent of over 1.1 million people were in favor, to 12.9 percent against.\\\"The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas!\\\" Musk wrote in a follow-up post shortly after the vote closed. \\\"Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.\\\"Tesla was incorporated in Delaware in July 2003, but has recently had somewhat of a falling out with the state: the same day Musk launched his poll, a judge tossed out his $56 billion pay packet from the company, describing it as \\\"an unfathomable sum\\\" that would disadvantage shareholders, Reuters reported.But the move also makes sense for the company. Tesla is already headquartered in Texas, having decided to move from Palo Alto, California, in 2021, and has one of five domestic gigafactories there.In 2021, it also emerged that Tesla was building a 100-megawatt battery storage project in Angleton, south of Houston. Musk and Texas Governor Greg Abbott were pictured together last May to celebrate breaking ground on a new lithium refinery in Robstown that will produce the key component in electric vehicle batteries.Texas already has the third-highest number of registered electric vehicles among U.S. states as of the end of 2022, according to figures from the Department of Energy, next to California and Florida.Musk has appeared to have a falling out with lawmakers in California of late. When moving Tesla's headquarters, the billionaire indicated that a 2020 post in which a California assembly member referred to him with a four-letter word had been a factor in the decision.It came after Abbott said that the SpaceX proprietor \\\"had to get out of California\\\" over the state's politics while claiming Musk \\\"consistently tells me that he likes the social policies in the state of Texas.\\\" Musk previously criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom over his coronavirus pandemic policies.Companies are usually either incorporated in the state that is their main base of operations or where the legal and tax environment is considered more business-friendly.To change the state in which Tesla is incorporated, Musk will have to register the company in Texas before legally dissolving it in Delaware. Not all states allow businesses to incorporate themselves elsewhere, but both Texas and Delaware do.Update 2/1/24, 6:16 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include further information.Correction 2/1/24, 7:32 a.m. ET: This article was updated with a correction to figures\",\"source\":\"Newsweek\",\"date\":\"2024-02-01T08:23:41.000Z\",\"props\":{\"type\":\"article\",\"site_name\":\"Newsweek\",\"url\":\"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-move-tesla-texas-incorporation-1865897\",\"title\":\"Elon Musk to move Tesla to Texas\",\"description\":\"The billionaire CEO announced the electric car company would be incorporated in the Lone Start State following an online poll.\",\"image\":\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2343309/elon-musk-texas.jpg\",\"image:alt\":\"Elon Musk Texas\",\"image:width\":\"1266\",\"image:height\":\"844\"},\"language\":\"EN\",\"created_at\":\"2024-02-01T15:48:24.103Z\",\"hostname\":\"newsweek.com\",\"id\":\"3593ced6175b50c1e958a731cd7c28ba\"},{\"_score\":21.79468,\"title\":\"Elon Musk: Tesla will hold a shareholder vote to incorporate in Texas\",\"link\":\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/elon-musk-tesla-will-hold-a-shareholder-vote-to-incorporate-in-texas.html\",\"description\":\"Musk's X post comes after a judge in Delaware, where Tesla is currently incorporated, voided the $56 billion\u00a0pay\u00a0package granted to the billionaire in 2018.\",\"body\":null,\"source\":\"CNBC\",\"date\":\"2024-02-01T06:59:57.000Z\",\"props\":{\"type\":\"article\",\"title\":\"Elon Musk says Tesla will hold a shareholder vote to incorporate in Texas after Delaware pay snub\",\"description\":\"Musk's X post comes after a judge in Delaware, where Tesla is currently incorporated, voided the $56 billion\u00a0pay\u00a0package granted to the billionaire in 2018.\",\"url\":\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/elon-musk-tesla-will-hold-a-shareholder-vote-to-incorporate-in-texas.html\",\"site_name\":\"CNBC\",\"image\":\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107362492-1705943497451-gettyimages-1952768063-omm_0137_glqhhy5f.jpeg?v=1706651704&w=1920&h=1080\"},\"language\":\"EN\",\"created_at\":\"2024-02-01T11:58:50.184Z\",\"hostname\":\"cnbc.com\",\"id\":\"f0104bc9389c7303d1edd5787addc90a\"},{\"_score\":21.27139,\"title\":\"Musk Moves Ahead With Plan to Incorporate Tesla in Texas\",\"link\":\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/musk-is-getting-a-resounding-yes-for-texas-after-pay-rejection\",\"description\":\"Elon Musk wants to deepen his links to Texas after a loss in court over his compensation at Tesla Inc.\",\"body\":null,\"source\":\"Bloomberg Law\",\"date\":\"2024-02-01T05:57:00.000Z\",\"props\":{\"title\":\"Musk Moves Ahead With Plan to Incorporate Tesla in Texas\",\"type\":\"article\",\"description\":\"Elon Musk wants to deepen his links to Texas after a loss in court over his compensation at Tesla Inc.\",\"url\":\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/musk-is-getting-a-resounding-yes-for-texas-after-pay-rejection\",\"image\":\"https://news-cdn.bindg.com/indg/assets/news/images/Fallback-image.webp\"},\"language\":\"EN\",\"created_at\":\"2024-02-01T15:59:24.033Z\",\"hostname\":\"news.bloomberglaw.com\",\"id\":\"ed73f8d6716e49ed98dc75fc2aaf7aa1\"},{\"_score\":19.792997,\"title\":\"MSN\",\"link\":\"https://www.msn.com/en-ae/money/companies/hundreds-of-business-execs-just-ranked-elon-musk-america-s-most-overrated-ceo/ar-BB1hAoYc\",\"description\":null,\"body\":null,\"source\":\"MSN\",\"date\":\"2024-02-01T05:54:23.000Z\",\"props\":{},\"language\":\"EN\",\"created_at\":\"2024-02-01T10:48:43.855Z\",\"hostname\":\"msn.com\",\"id\":\"cce35dbf0521a697abba7152400aa3c6\"},{\"_score\":4.6505857,\"title\":\"Megacap stocks keep lifting US market, but worries over their dominance grow\",\"link\":\"https://www.zawya.com/en/opinion/markets-insights/megacap-stocks-keep-lifting-us-market-but-worries-over-their-dominance-grow-gzd5dwvw\",\"description\":\"Last year, eye-popping gains for the huge tech and growth stocks accounted for the bulk of the S&amp;P 500's 24% rise, with the hefty market values of the seven making them a driving force in the market cap-weighted index\",\"body\":\"NEW YORK - Earnings reports this week from five of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks are putting a renewed focus on risks from the group\u2019s outsize weighting in the S&P 500, while their collective strength continues pushing U.S. equities to record highs. Last year, eye-popping gains for the huge tech and growth stocks accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 24% rise, with the hefty market values of the seven making them a driving force in the market cap-weighted index. Their performance has already helped drive the S&P 500 up over 3% this year as of Tuesday's close. But concerns have grown that the companies' huge influence can work both ways, dragging down the broader indexes if they falter. Analysts at JPMorgan said on Tuesday the market\u2019s narrow leadership was becoming \u201cincreasingly unhealthy,\u201d with the Magnificent Seven -- Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla -- accounting for nearly 29% of the S&P 500. Should the Magnificent Seven stocks weaken, they are \u201cgoing to have a serious impact on the indices because of the high weight they have,\u201d said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \u201cAny meaningful pullback in tech is going to knock down the major averages and scare a lot of investors.\u201d The Nasdaq Composite Index is also market cap-weighted, while the 30-component Dow Jones Industrial Average is price-weighted. Of the Magnificent Seven, only Apple and Microsoft are part of the Dow Jones. The current earnings season is poised to be a test of whether the megacap companies can live up to investors' lofty expectations. The early returns were dour: All of the Magnificent Seven were trading lower on Wednesday morning, weighing on the S&P 500, following results from Microsoft and Alphabet late on Tuesday. Microsoft, whose market value recently topped $3 trillion, beat estimates for quarterly revenue, but shares were off over 1% as investors absorbed news about rising costs to develop artificial intelligence features. Shares of Google parent Alphabet sank over 6%, as its holiday-season advertising sales disappointed and the company said spending on items such as servers to power AI would jump this year. Wednesday's share-price drops pared their respective year-to-date gains, with Microsoft last up 7% in 2024 and Alphabet up about 1.5%. Shares of Nvidia are up about 23% this year and Meta Platforms has gained 11%. Tesla shares, on the other hand, are down 23% so far in 2024, tumbling last week after CEO Elon Musk warned sales growth would slow this year. The Magnificent Seven represent 28.6% of the S&P 500, up from 27.8% at the end of 2023, and close to the highest weight ever for that group of stocks, according to LSEG Datastream data. In 2023, the Magnificent Seven individually soared between around 50% and 240%, and were collectively responsible for 62% of the S&P 500's total return. CHALLENGE FOR ACTIVE MANAGERS While that kind of performance has thrilled many investors, it has presented a more challenging environment for active fund managers, who seek to beat gauges such as the S&P 500 or Russell 1000 because many have held allocations to the Magnificent Seven that are smaller relative to the stocks' weighting in those indexes. Only 23% of large-cap funds that benchmark against the Russell 1000 beat the index last year, according to JPMorgan data. Fund managers may hold less of the stocks for a variety of reasons, including a desire for portfolio flexibility, worries over owning too much of any one position and limitations imposed by the rules of their own funds. \\\"In an environment like this, diversified funds will struggle,\\\" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services. \\\"When you have just a few companies that are leading the way, managers can\u2019t own those companies in enough bulk to offset that concentration of performance at the top.\\\" Indeed, the S&P 500 beat the equal-weight S&P 500, a proxy for the average stock in the index, by 12 percentage points last year. The equal weight index is trailing again so far in 2024, up just 0.4%. In a note on Tuesday, BofA Global Research said the Magnificent Seven account for almost 20% of the market cap of the MSCI's world equities index, with Apple and Microsoft each nearly the size of Japan, the second-largest country in the index.

The company, a joint venture between Colorado-based Voyager Space and Europe\u2019s Airbus, announced on Wednesday that it has secured a launch provider for the mission\u2014and it\u2019s a company you may have heard of.\\n\\nIt\u2019s SpaceX, of course. The Elon Musk-led aerospace firm will use its Starship megarocket for the required lifting duties owing to the anticipated size and weight of the space station, eponymously named Starlab. \u201cSpaceX\u2019s history of success and reliability led our team to select Starship to orbit Starlab,\u201d Dylan Taylor, chairman and CEO of Voyager Space, said in a statement, adding that \u201cStarlab will be launched to orbit in a single flight by Starship.\u201d\\n\\nRelated article: Voyager Space and Airbus to Collaborate on Commercial Successor to the ISS\\n\\nBig rockets allow you to do big things. In this case, they make it possible to deliver a 26-foot-wide (eight-meter) space station built from stainless steel. Manfred Jaumann, vice president of low Earth orbit and suborbital programs at Airbus, disclosed these specifications at a German tech expo this past November, saying Starlab will be too large and heavy for any launch vehicles currently in service or being developed, save for Starship, as SpaceNews reports. Starlab\u2019s exact weight is not yet known. But Starship, also made from stainless steel (I\u2019m sensing a fetish here), has an anticipated lift capacity of 150 metric tons to low Earth orbit, a destination otherwise known as LEO. \\n\\nOf course, Starship is not yet ready for prime time. The megarocket has performed two test flights to date, with a third planned in February. Pinpointing an exact timeframe for the rocket\u2019s operational flight certification is difficult given its highly experimental nature. Powered by 33 Raptor engines, this two-stage rocket is the largest and most powerful ever constructed and is designed for full reusability.\\n\\nStarlab, set to reach LEO in 2028, will be fully equipped on the ground for fuss-free operations, eliminating the need for space assembly, thus saving time and costs. As Voyager Space president Matt Kuta told Payload: \u201cIt cannot be understated, the significance of the single launch to orbit, not two-three-four launches, to close the business plan.\u201d \\n\\nOnce operational, Starlab will continually house a crew of four astronauts conducting a range of experiments. Utilizing its orbital position, these experiments will take advantage of conditions like microgravity and exposure to the radioactive space environment. Starlab Space intends to use this station to cater to space agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), various researchers, and commercial companies.\\n\\nOver the last year, the Starlab team has achieved key milestones such as Systems Requirements and Definition Reviews, along with Human in the Loop testing. The company  is planning collaborations with ESA, Hilton Hotels, and The Ohio State University. Starlab Space has undergone significant changes recently; Lockheed Martin has been replaced by Northrop Grumman, which will provide its autonomous Cygnus spacecraft for cargo missions. In anticipation of its future space station needs, NASA has supported this initiative by investing $217.5 million in the consortium.\\n\\nFor more spaceflight in your life, follow us on X (formerly Twitter) and bookmark Gizmodo\u2019s dedicated Spaceflight page.\",\"source\":\"Gizmodo\",\"date\":\"2024-01-31T21:45:00.000Z\",\"props\":{\"title\":\"SpaceX's Giant Starship Tapped to Launch Starlab's Giant Steel Space Station\",\"description\":\"The commercial space station could reach low Earth orbit as early as 2028, just ahead of the planned decommissioning of the ISS.\",\"image\":\"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/5f5bd2e96b3ea0c39d5a4e0b498671d9.jpg\",\"url\":\"https://gizmodo.com/spacexs-giant-starship-tapped-to-launch-starlabs-giant-1851212599\",\"locale\":\"en_US\",\"site_name\":\"Gizmodo\",\"type\":\"article\"},\"language\":\"EN\",\"created_at\":\"2024-02-01T03:57:53.462Z\",\"hostname\":\"gizmodo.com\",\"id\":\"4128f75daaef11966343418e3ed3bcc3\"},{\"_score\":21.609123,\"title\":\"Elon Musk goes all-in on Texas over his $55 billion pay package rejection\",\"link\":\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2024/01/31/elon-musk-goes-all-in-on-texas-over-his-55-billion-pay-package-rejection/\",\"description\":\"Musk is threatening to shift Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas from Delaware after a judge in the tiny state voided his $55 billion compensation package.
