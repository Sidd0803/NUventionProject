Elon Musk claimed to have successfully put a Neuralink implant into a human for the first time this week                A monkey with the Neuralink chip implanted in their brain is seen playing a game.\u00a0DailyMail.com can reveal that monkeys had operations on their skulls up to 10 times each before being put down during the testing phase         Neuralink has killed at least 1,500 animals including sheep and pigs during its quest for a chip which will allow people to control devices with their minds         Photos obtained by DailyMail.com of the UC Davis lab show small metal cages stacked on top of one anotherDeath reports reveal that monkeys had parts of their limbs amputated and were put down after repeatedly vomiting and having episodes of diarrhea.All told, Neuralink has killed at least 1,500 animals including sheep and pigs during its quest for a chip which will allow people to control electronic devices with their minds.The documents were obtained by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a campaign group, which said that the monkeys endured 'extreme suffering' during a 'systematic disregard' for their lives.PCRM said that the public should be skeptical about claims by Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder, who bragged this week: 'Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. That is the goal.'Last month he said Neuralink was looking at quadriplegics under 40 years old to take part in human trials, where a surgeon would remove part of their skull before a robot implanted 64 threads lined with electrodes on the brain.In a statement to DailyMail.com, PCRM said that Musk had a 'long track record of misleading the public about Neuralink's supposed developments.'The statement said: 'Neuralink has a well-documented history of conducting unnecessary, sloppy experiments in monkeys, pigs, sheep, and other animals that raise serious concerns about the safety of its device.'As such, the public should continue to be skeptical of the safety and functionality of any device produced by Neuralink'.The statement added that 'Musk's true intentions for Neuralink are disturbingly clear.'It said: 'He has repeatedly said the goal of the company is ''to achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence'' which is not necessarily in line with developing treatments for patients.'         A report states that a 'burr hole' was made in a monkey's head until the brain was exposed. The implant was put in and tested then the creature was euthanized                  Perhaps the most disturbing documents of all are the death reports for each monkey. One monkey known as 'Animal 8' had 'multiple digit tips amputated' and had 'diarrhea in the first year of life', one note states         Emails between Neuralink and UC Davis staffers reveal floor plan discussions with a room available to 'house 8 animals'\u00a0         The layout of the UC Davis lab shows 2.5ft 'mobile homecage w/ squeeze' which is where the animals are believed to have been caged\u00a0Neuralink partnered with UC Davis from 2017 to 2020 after which it brought its research program in-house with facilities in California and Austin, Texas, where it is based.The 1,500 animals that have been killed reportedly include more than 280 sheep, pigs and monkeys.While Musk reportedly said that he wanted test monkeys to live in a 'monkey Taj Mahal', photos obtained by DailyMail.com of the UC Davis lab paint a far starker reality with small metal cages stacked on top of one another.NEURALINK: ELON MUSK'S PLAY FOR COMPUTER-BRAIN INTERFACESElon Musk's Neuralink is working to link the human brain with a machine interface by creating micron-sized devices.Neuralink was registered in California as a 'medical research' company in July 2016, and Musk has funded the company mostly by himself.It is working on what Musk calls the 'neural lace' technology, implanting tiny brain electrodes that may one day upload and download thoughts.\u00a0The technology is initially planned to be used to help people suffering from severe degenerative brain disorders such as ALS, but it could have wider uses in years to come. AdvertisementThe documents include the contracts between Neuralink and UC Davis which stated that the university would be paid $796,006 for the first round of testing from July 2017 to July 2018.In chilling detail, one bill stated the expenses included $11,870.40 on purchasing three animals and $14,349.12 on the surgery.In the comments section UC Davis remarked that there would be '16 hour terminal surgery' and that the necropsy will require 'evening / OT charges', apparently meaning overtime charges for staff.The document was signed by Ahmad Hakim-Elahi, the executive director of the research administration at UC Davis.Among the others who are named in the documents is Dr. John Morrison, a professor of neurology.The total amount that Neuralink paid appears to be well above $1million.An email dated January 26, 2021 from AnnMarie Boyland, the director of administration and operations at UC Davis, states that the college had a 'max agreement' with Neuralink of $1,296,006.However there were additional invoices: one for $487,207 and a subsequent one for $186,034, making a total of $1,969,247.According to the files, the monkeys tested at UC Davis were split into four groups, the first of which 'will not be allowed to surgically recover (terminal procedure)'.'The overarching goal will be to behaviorally program implanted animals and test take performance outputs in preconditioned monkeys', the file states.The animals would be prepared for surgery by being given drugs like valium and fentanyl and anesthetics, after which an incision up to 10cm long will be made on their scalps.The guidelines admit that the fit for each implant 'may not be perfect' and that bone screws would be used to anchor it in place.Among the tests that were conducted were behavioral training which mapped neural activity to what the monkey was doing.The animals would reach to specific locations with their hands or do short term memory exercises which would be reinforced using treats, which are described as a 'slurry of blended monkey biscuits' or other treats.         A request to amend the regular protocol from July 2019 noted that the implant was approximately the size of a quarter coin, or 22.5mm in diameter         A device called 'Telepathy' has reportedly been implanted in an unnamed patient         A protocol for 'animal use and care' which expired in July 2021 stated that the animals may be forced to sit in a 'chair' which is defined as a 'plastic box' which forces them to sit in an upright position'         One bill stated the study expenses included $11,870.40 on purchasing three animals and $14,349.12 on the surgery for a total of $83,945.71A protocol for 'animal use and care' which expired in July 2021 stated that the animals may be forced to sit in a 'chair' - which is defined as a 'plastic box- which forces them to sit in an upright position.The document notes that if the animal won't put its head through the neck plate of the box chair they wanted the option to sedate the creature and it be given a collar to keep it in position.In a disturbing passage, the document states: 'Animals will be chair restrained for a maximum of five hours over the course of a single day. They may be chair restrained multiple times in a single day. Chair restraint may be performed every day, including weekends'.A request to amend the regular protocol from July 2019 noted that the implant was approximately the size of a quarter coin, or 22.5mm in diameter.It would be anchored to the monkey's skull using 'bone screws, dental acrylic and/or other approved materials.'The request states: 'The device is designed to sit flush within the bone of a typical human skull so we expect it to protrude slightly when implanted into the macaque skull.'Option to cover with acrylic: As our goal is a fully subcutaneous implant, we intend to use skin closure over the implant. However, it may not be possible to close the skin over the device without unacceptable tenting and/or risk of skin erosion, and we may, as a last resort, form a percutaneous acrylic implant over the device using approved materials and method'.A note from the same month addressed the issue of using Bioglue on one monkey.It stated: 'At the time of skin closing the lead surgeon had concerns about the void in between the two implants and applied Bioglue to fill the dead space in between the implants on midline.'According to protocol, Bioglue and bacitracin were not listed for approved use. The protocol is a composite of a previous withdrawn protocol and miscellaneous amendments. One past amendment addressed the adverse effect of Bioglue coming in contact with an animal subject's brain surface.'The preventative action arising from this event was to discontinue the use of Bioglue'.The document notes that the lead surgeon 'did not realize' that they could not use Bioglue and that staff were being retrained to not use it in the future.         Pictured is an image of a monkey from Neuralink's website. According to document states, 'Animals will be chair restrained for a maximum of five hours over the course of a single day. They may be chair restrained multiple times in a single day'         Pictured are the cages where animals were kept during the study at the UC Davis lab.\u00a0UC Davis observed the animal 'hunching' and looking 'lethargic', a report states       Under 'potential adverse effects, a March 2021 email reads that the bone screws will lead to a 'number of holes in the cranium' of the monkeys.The needle used by the robot which was used to insert threads into the implant 'could break and leave shards in the brain', the document notes.Perhaps the most disturbing documents of all are the death reports for each monkey.One monkey known as 'Animal 8' had 'multiple digit tips amputated' and had 'diarrhea in the first year of life', the notes state.In addition, the creature underwent a vasectomy.A report states that a 'burr hole' was made in its head until the brain was exposed, the implant was put in and tested then the creature was euthanized.'Animal 4', an 11-year-old macaque monkey, was on antidepressants before being put down in July 2018.UC Davis observed the animal 'hunching' and looking 'lethargic'.Staff expected the monkey to live less than one month after one procedure, however it lived another seven months.Another monkey, known as 'Animal 5' was observed having 'patchy alopecia' and significant hair loss.A worse fate awaited a monkey called 'Animal 6' which underwent a highly invasive procedure in October 2018 in which staff drilled holes in its skull and put electrodes on the creature's brain.Two months later the area around the implant became infected meaning lab staff had to use 'copious amounts' of antibiotics to clean it.Other monkeys were seen to engage in self mutilating behavior or had multiple seizures.         The dossier is far from the first time that Neuralink has come under fire for its treatment of test animals.In December 2022, Reuters reported that the company was under investigation by the USDA and the Department of Justice for animal welfare violations.That month members of Congress wrote to the USDA to raise concerns about animal welfare at Neuralink.Additional records obtained by PCRM in February last year that UC Davis may have breached federal law by transporting infectious pathogens without safely packaging them.This month it emerged that the Department of Transport fined Neuralink for breaches of federal hazardous materials laws in relation to the claims made by PCRM.Neuralink was also in the headlines when it emerged that Musk had fathered two children with Shivon Zilis, an executive with the company.DailyMail.com has contacted UC Davis and Neuralink for comment.Neuralink has previously said that it is 'absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible'.UC Davis has said that it 'follows all applicable laws and regulations'.The college has refused to release 371 photographs of the monkeys it experimented on for Neuralink.CaliforniaElon MuskShare or comment on this article:                         Inside Elon Musk's Neuralink lab where 1,500 animals have been killed and test monkeys were subjected to 'extreme suffering'e-mail1.2ksharesComments 2584\t    Share what you think          NewestOldestBest ratedWorst rated\u00a0View allThe comments below have not been moderated.\u00a0View all      The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.

He would almost certainly face investor lawsuits, particularly if it was seen as a move to secure his pay package, legal experts said.\"Shareholders need to take a hard look at how transitioning out of Delaware might impact their rights and the company's governance,\" Independent business adviser Keith Donovan said.There could also be some dispute over the level of support Musk would need to change Tesla's governing rules for the move.Some specific changes require two-thirds of shareholders to back. If Tesla were to adopt a Texas charter that did not change the provisions that require a super majority, it would likely be able to move to Texas with a simple majority, said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane University Law School.It would take at least 40 to 60 days to organize a shareholder vote, although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could slow the process by requiring additional disclosures, she said.Tesla shares closed about 1% higher on Thursday. After more than doubling in 2023, the stock has lost roughly a quarter of its value this year due to growing concerns of soft EV demand.The ruling is not the first time that Musk has suffered a setback in Delaware.McCormick was the same judge who oversaw Twitter's July 2022 lawsuit against Musk after he tried to back out of his contract to buy the social media platform for $44 billion. The judge rejected his delaying tactics and Musk finally went through with the deal.\"Musk must believe that Texas judges are more 'business friendly' than their Delaware counterparts... Musk must be assuming that Texas judges will...take a more relaxed approach to the issue than Delaware judges,\" said Brian Cheffins, a professor of corporate law at Cambridge University.\"It is far from clear Texas judges will do so.\"More than 65% of Fortune 500 companies and over half of all U.S. publicly traded companies are incorporated in Delaware, lured by the state's business-friendly legal framework and tax policies, according to Harvard Business Services, a firm offering Delaware business formation services.U.S. public companies look to incorporate in Delaware for access to the state's courts. Its corporate law places greater restraints on management and is more protective of investors than states like Nevada, making it cheaper for Delaware companies to raise capital.TripAdvisor and its parent company are currently defending a lawsuit by their shareholders, who have challenged the company's plans to re-incorporate in Nevada from Delaware.MUSK AND LONE STARMusk has also recently said he would be uncomfortable growing the automaker to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics without at least 25% voting control of the company, which is nearly double his current stake.\"\"What's more concerning is he has a lot of AI efforts in Tesla, and if he doesn't get his way with his pay package, what will he do in terms of those efforts diminishing in Tesla and going somewhere else?\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at shareholder Globalt Investments.Musk has more than a small interest in Texas.He shifted Tesla's corporate headquarters to the state from California in 2021 after criticizing California's regulations and taxes, and clashing with health officials at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic over reopening a factory in Fremont.One of the EV maker's gigafactories is in Texas, where it is also planning an over $750 million expansion. It is also building a lithium refinery in the state, aiming to produce enough for about 1 million EVs by 2025.Musk's other companies - SpaceX and The Boring Company - also have operations in Texas.Musk, like in the past, held a poll on X, and proclaimed that the 87% \"yes\" vote out of 1.1 million total votes was a deciding factor.\"The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,\" Musk said on X.(Reporting by Maria Ponnezhath, Shubham Kalia, Samrhitha Arunasalam and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Tom Hals in Wilmington and Martin Coulter in London; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Sayantani Ghosh and Arun Koyyur) View comments Up nextUp nextUp nextUp nextUp nextUp nextUp next", "Elon Musk Initiates the Process To Move Tesla\u2019s State of Incorporation to Texas After Setbacks in Delaware Menu News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Software Deals Reviews Videos How ToWccftechNewsHardwareGamingMobileFinanceSoftwareDealsReviewsVideosHow ToFinanceElon Musk Initiates the Process To Move Tesla\u2019s State of Incorporation to Texas After Setbacks in DelawareRohail Saleem \u2022Feb 1, 2024 07:13 AM EST\u2022Copy Shortlink\t\t\t\t\tThis is not investment advice.

With 87 percent of the votes in favor, Elon Musk has announced that Tesla's shareholders will now be called upon to approve this arduous relocation.As we noted last week, the Delaware Court of Chancery has voided Elon Musk's 2018 compensation plan, widely believed to be the world's largest such executive pay package, one that had enabled generous awards based on Tesla's market capitalization thresholds.Tesla underwent a trial in Delaware in 2022, where some shareholders asserted that Elon Musk's 2018 compensation plan should be voided by the court as it was a result of sham negotiations. The plaintiffs argued that Tesla's shareholders were never informed that Elon Musk directly dictated the specific terms of the package and that the company's directors were personally beholden to Musk.Delaware Chancery Court Chief Judge, Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, ultimately agreed with the plaintiffs and voided Elon Musk's $55 billion compensation plan.\u00a0Do note that Elon Musk currently owns roughly 13 percent of Tesla, corresponding to around 412 million shares. The CEO of Tesla also owned around 304 million unexercised stock options as part of his 2018 compensation plan, entitling the EV giant's CEO to around 9 percent of Tesla's 3.2 billion outstanding common shares. These options have now been voided by the court.Tesla can, of course, appeal this decision or come up with a new compensation package. The latter option, however, carries the risk of prolonged negotiations. Elon Musk has demanded a 25 percent voting control over the EV giant to prevent being \"overturned\" on occasion, threatening to \"build products outside of Tesla\" should he fail to secure the requisite voting power.Bear in mind that it was the Delaware Court of Chancery that had compelled Elon Musk to go through with his initial $44 billion purchase offer for the X social media platform.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShare this story\t\t\t\t Facebook TwitterDeal of the DayFurther Reading Researchers Just Controlled a Virtual Rendition of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck During Sleep Elon Musk Loses the World\u2019s Largest Executive Compensation Plan Tesla To Spend Billions of Dollars On NVIDIA AI Hardware This Year, Also Plans on Buying AMD Chips Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink Fined for Storing Hazardous Materials Without Proper ProtocolsCommentsPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.Trending StoriesNancy Pelosi Creates a Buzz by Buying up Shares in the Cyber Security Company Palo Alto Networks (PANW)\t\t\t\t26 Active ReadersThese iPad Models Will Not be Compatible With Apple\u2019s iPadOS 18 Update, Missing Out on AI Features\t\t\t\t22 Active ReadersDell Claims It\u2019s Precision 3680 Tower Workstation With Intel Core i9-14900K CPU Offers \u201cWorld\u2019s Fastest Single-Threaded\u201d Performance\t\t\t\t19 Active ReadersSamsung Is Going To Mass Produce Half A Million Galaxy Ring Units Initially, Shows The Company Has High Hopes\t\t\t\t13 Active ReadersPlayStation 5 Pro AI Upscaling Will Run on the GPU, as Viola APU Has No NPUs \u2013 Rumor\t\t\t\t13 Active ReadersPopular DiscussionsIntel CEO Confirms TSMC\u2019s Process Nodes To Power Next-Gen CPUs: N3 For Arrow Lake & N3B For Lunar Lake\t\t\t\t2864 CommentsIntel Adds 14A Process Node To Its Roadmap, Updates To 18A & Intel 3 Nodes Unveiled at IFS Direct\t\t\t\t1793 CommentsAMD Radeon RX 7700 XT GPU Gets Official Price Drop, Now Available For $419 US\t\t\t\t1644 CommentsIntel CEO Hopes To Make Chips For AMD As Chipzilla Kickstarts Its Custom Chip Business With Intel Foundry\t\t\t\t1425 CommentsMicrosoft DirectX DirectSR \u201cSuper Resolution\u201d Technology To Debut At GDC, Working With AMD & NVIDIA\t\t\t\t1219 Comments\t\u00a0Subscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your inboxEmail address\u00a0Follow us onFacebookYoutubeTwitterTopicsHardwareGamingMobileFinanceSoftwareSecurityWebSectionsDealsReviewsVideosHow To'sAnalysisExclusivesInterviewsCompanyAboutAdvertise with UsContactTip UsCareersTerms of UsePrivacy & Cookie PolicyEthics StatementAppeal ModerationSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Musk made the announcement on X, the former Twitter, which he acquired in October of 2022 for $44 billion. Musk had already posted a poll on whether to reincorporate in Nevada or Texas, where the company is now headquartered, immediately after the ruling.Earlier Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor\u00a0Kathaleen McCormick struck down Musk\u2019s pay package, the biggest ever awarded to an executive in the U.S., siding with a shareholder plaintiff and calling the process to arrive at that eye-watering number \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d \u201cMusk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla\u2019s behalf\u201d and the package\u2019s working group included people \u201cbeholden to Musk,\u201d she wrote in a 200-page ruling. The judge also called the package, granted some five years ago and, like previous packages, contingent upon Tesla hitting several milestones, \u201chistorically unprecedented.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s ruling means that the company will have to draft a new compensation package for Musk.

Great seeing the improvements.'\u00a0Another added: 'Gait is a lot more natural looking than I expected.'Notable in the video is the absence of a white metal covering the robot's chest, meaning its inner parts are visible.\u00a0Optimus was first announced at Tesla's AI Day event in August 2021, but more than two years later there's no official confirmation of when it will be released to the public.\u00a0The first prototype of the robot was unveiled a year later, although it couldn't do much more than walk across the stage and wave.\u00a0Tesla revealed an\u00a0updated prototype of the humanoid robot ('Gen 2') in a clip in December\u00a02023, even though the first version never went on sale.\u00a0         X (Twitter) users replied by jokingly expressing their concerns about robots taking over the world         Several users suggested the speed of the machine is similar to US President Joe Biden, now 81 years old         'Already walks faster than the leader of the free world': But can President Biden deadlift 150 pounds?\u00a0         Musk posted the video on X (formerly Twitter) with the caption: 'Going for a walk with Optimus'         Several others suggested the speed of the machine is similar to US President Joe Biden, now 81 years old READ MORE Optimus robot poaches an EGG in new video           A video shows Optimus Gen 2 walking, doing squats, and picking up an egg\u00a0 Advertisement In the video, Gen 2 is shown picking up and holding an egg without breaking it, thanks to\u00a0advanced tactile senses in its fingers.\u00a0Earlier in the year, another promo video showed\u00a0Optimus\u00a0demonstrating its balance as it moved through some basic yoga poses\u00a0and stood on one leg.\u00a0Optimus stands at nearly six foot tall, is able to walk at five miles per hour, and can deadlift 150 pounds according to Tesla.\u00a0Optimus includes the Autopilot computer used in the company's electric cars, which allows the humanoid to recognise real-world objects.\u00a0Musk has described it as a factory worker but one that could also make an 'incredible buddy like R2D2 or C3PO' for the everyday user in the home.\u00a0It's been designed to handle 'dangerous and boring' tasks in a factory and other settings, although it will be 'friendly' and make a 'very good companion', like a pet.\u00a0It should be able to handle a range of jobs \u2013 from attaching bolts to cars with a wrench, to picking up groceries in shops.\u00a0         Optimus Gen 2 can pick up an egg without breaking the shell due to its advanced tactile senses in its fingers         Optimus could make an 'incredible buddy like R2D2 or C3PO' from Star Wars (pictured) for the everyday user in the home       Musk noted that, unlike killer robots, the Tesla bot could be physically overpowered by the average human \u2013 suggesting it's less of a danger than it looks.\u00a0The South African-born entrepreneur has already been highly vocal about his concerns over AI, calling it 'much more dangerous than nukes' and 'more risk than North Korea'.\u00a0Customers will be able to buy Optimus between 2025 and 2027, according to Musk, with a retail price of 'probably less than $20,000' (\u00a316,000).\u00a0More updates could be given at Tesla's next AI Day event, which wasn't held in 2023 but is expected to return this summer.\u00a0\u00a0 A TIMELINE OF ELON MUSK'S COMMENTS ON AI\u00a0  Elon Musk is one of the most prominent names and faces in developing technologies.\u00a0The billionaire entrepreneur heads up SpaceX, Tesla and the Boring company.\u00a0But while he is on the forefront of creating AI technologies, he is also acutely aware of its dangers.\u00a0Here is a comprehensive timeline of all Musk's premonitions, thoughts and warnings about AI, so far.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0August 2014 - 'We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.'\u00a0October 2014 - 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I were to guess like what our biggest existential threat is, it\u2019s probably that. So we need to be very careful with the artificial intelligence.'October 2014 - 'With artificial intelligence we are summoning the demon.'\u00a0June 2016 - 'The benign situation with ultra-intelligent AI is that we would be so far below in intelligence we'd be like a pet, or a house cat.'July 2017\u00a0- 'I think AI is something that is risky at the civilisation level, not merely at the individual risk level, and that's why it really demands a lot of safety research.'\u00a0July 2017 - 'I have exposure to the very most\u00a0cutting-edge AI and I think people should be really concerned about it.'July 2017 - 'I keep sounding the alarm bell but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don\u2019t know how to react because it seems so ethereal.'August 2017 -\u00a0 'If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea.'November 2017\u00a0- 'Maybe there's a five to 10 percent chance of success [of making AI safe].'March 2018 - 'AI is much more dangerous than nukes. So why do we have no regulatory oversight?'\u00a0April 2018\u00a0- '[AI is] a very important subject. It's going to affect our lives in ways we can't even imagine right now.'April 2018\u00a0- '[We could create] an immortal dictator from which we would never escape.'\u00a0November 2018 - 'Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon & say who\u2019s the pet now.'September 2019 - 'If advanced AI (beyond basic bots) hasn\u2019t been applied to manipulate social media, it won\u2019t be long before it is.'February 2020\u00a0- 'At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn\u2019t just icing on the cake, it the cake.'July 2020\u00a0- 'We\u2019re headed toward a situation where AI is vastly smarter than humans and I think that time frame is less than five years from now. But that doesn\u2019t mean that everything goes to hell in five years. It just means that things get unstable or weird.'\u00a0April 2021: 'A major part of real-world AI has to be solved to make unsupervised, generalized full self-driving work.'February 2022: 'We have to solve a huge part of AI just to make cars drive themselves.'\u00a0December 2022: 'The danger of training AI to be woke \u2013 in other words, lie \u2013 is deadly.'\u00a0September 2023: 'The AI era is swiftly becoming real for the general public.'

A Tesla store in Colma, California on December 13, 2023David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesCNN        \u00a0\u2014\u00a0                Stung by a Delaware court ruling earlier this week that struck down his record Tesla pay package, Elon Musk says he is seeking shareholder approval to incorporate the company in Texas.                Soon after Tuesday\u2019s ruling about his 2018 salary package \u2014 worth about $51 billion at current stock prices \u2014 Musk put up a\u00a0poll on X asking if Tesla (TSLA) should move its registration from Delaware to Texas, where it is already headquartered.                Hours later, the Tesla CEO wrote that the \u201cpublic vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas.\u201d The poll results showed Texas\u00a0had won the backing of more than 87% of about 1.1 million votes.                Musk added he will now \u201cimmediately\u201d seek shareholder approval to incorporate the electric carmaker in the southern state.    Delaware is famously one of the world\u2019s most welcoming places for companies of all kinds and sizes to incorporate for legal and tax purposes. Nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated there.    Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersRelated articleWho can rein in Elon Musk? Someone you\u2019ve probably never heard of            It is seen as a desirable place to seek approval for mergers and litigate disputes, and doesn\u2019t levy sales tax or tax on profits from intellectual property.                While Musk has not commented directly on the judgment on his pay package, he tweeted\u00a0Tuesday: \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\u201d                \u201cI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,\u201d he said in another\u00a0tweet.                Attorneys for the Tesla shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the company\u2019s directors were too close to Musk to protect their interests.                The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received as part of the package are worth $51 billion today, when calculated using Tuesday\u2019s closing price, less the modest exercise price of $23.34 a share.                Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench\u00a0trial that concluded in November 2022, ruled Tuesday\u00a0that Musk and the Tesla board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d    RelatedAd FeedbackAd FeedbackCNN Business VideosMcDonald\u2019s aims to attract younger crowd with new drink2:24                    Feb 27, 2024                KENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty ImagesMacy\u2019s downsizing stores to reinvest in luxury retail1:06                    Feb 27, 2024                Is Hong Kong still \u2018Asia\u2019s world city\"?3:35                    Feb 27, 2024                Ryanair CEO says Boeing delays could lead to fare hikes1:49                    Feb 27, 2024                Ad FeedbackAd FeedbackSearch        Log In            My Account          Settings                  Topics You Follow                    Log Out        Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN account        Live TV              Listen              Watch              US                  Crime + Justice                      Energy + Environment                      Extreme Weather                      Space + Science                  World                  Africa                      Americas                      Asia                      Australia                      China                      Europe                      India                      Middle East                      United Kingdom                  Politics                  SCOTUS                      Congress                      Facts First                      2024 Elections                  Business                  Tech                      Media                      Calculators                      Videos                  Markets                  Pre-markets                      After-Hours                      Market Movers                      Fear & Greed                      World Markets                      Investing                      Markets Now                      Before the Bell                      Nightcap                  Opinion                  Political Op-Eds                      Social Commentary                  Health                  Life, But Better                      Fitness                      Food                      Sleep                      Mindfulness                      Relationships                  Entertainment                  Movies                      Television                      Celebrity                  Tech                  Innovate                      Gadget                      Foreseeable Future                      Mission: Ahead                      Upstarts                      Work Transformed                      Innovative Cities                  Style                  Arts                      Design                      Fashion                      Architecture                      Luxury                      Beauty                      Video                  Travel                  Destinations                      Food & Drink                      Stay                      News                      Videos                  Sports                  Pro Football                      College Football                      Basketball                      Baseball                      Soccer                      Olympics                      Hockey                  Watch                  Live TV                      CNN Headlines                      CNN Max                      Digital Studios                      CNN Films                      HLN                      TV Schedule                      TV Shows A-Z                      CNNVR                  Listen              CNN Underscored                  Electronics                      Fashion                      Beauty                      Health & Fitness                      Home                      Reviews                      Deals                      Money                      Gifts                      Travel                      Outdoors                      Pets                      CNN Store                  Coupons              Weather                  Climate                      Storm Tracker                      Wildfire Tracker                      Video                  About CNN                  Photos                      Investigations                      CNN Profiles                      CNN Leadership                      CNN Newsletters                      Work for CNN                      Watch                      Listen                      Live TV          Follow CNN Business        Log In            My Account          Settings                  Topics You Follow                    Log Out        Your CNN accountLog in to your CNN accountMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

A resounding 87.1 percent of over 1.1 million people were in favor, to 12.9 percent against.\"The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas!\" Musk wrote in a follow-up post shortly after the vote closed. \"Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.\"The same day Musk launched his poll, a judge in Delaware ruled in favor of Tesla shareholders who said the company's board had improperly approved his $56 billion pay packet. The judge described the pay deal as \"an unfathomable sum\" that would disadvantage shareholders, Reuters reported.CEO of Tesla Motors Elon Musk on April 7, 2022, in Austin, Texas.

Tesla is already headquartered in Texas, having decided to move from Palo Alto, California, in 2021, and has one of five domestic gigafactories there.In 2021, it also emerged that Tesla was building a 100-megawatt battery storage project in Angleton, south of Houston. Musk and Texas Governor Greg Abbott were pictured together last May to celebrate breaking ground on a new lithium refinery in Robstown that will produce the key component in electric vehicle batteries.Texas already has the third-highest number of registered electric vehicles among U.S. states as of the end of 2022, according to figures from the Department of Energy, next to California and Florida.Musk has appeared to have a falling out with lawmakers in California of late. When moving Tesla's headquarters, the billionaire indicated that a 2020 post in which a California assembly member referred to him with a four-letter word had been a factor in the decision.

Not all states allow businesses to incorporate themselves elsewhere, but both Texas and Delaware do.Update 2/1/24, 6:16 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include further information.Correction 2/1/24, 7:32 a.m. ET: This article was updated with a correction to figures.Update 2/2/24, 8:02 a.m. ET: The headline to this story was changed.Uncommon KnowledgeNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

More than 80% of those who voted said yes. Polls on the social media platform are informal and not comparable to professional public opinion research.After the poll, Musk said, Tesla \"will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas.\" Musk will likely have to seek approval from the Tesla board to enact such a move. Tesla is currently incorporated in Delaware.Musk's X post comes after a judge in Delaware voided the $56 billion\u00a0pay\u00a0package for the Tesla\u00a0CEO granted in 2018, the largest compensation plan\u00a0in public corporate history. Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick\u00a0ruled that the company's board of directors failed to prove \"that the compensation plan was fair\" or show much evidence that they had even negotiated with Musk.Musk subsequently expressed dislike for the state.\"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\" Musk posted on X this week.CNBC asked Columbia Law School professor Eric Talley why would Musk want to, and why would shareholders prefer if Tesla reincorporated in Texas.The professor said, for one thing, Texas is more lax about paying large sums to CEOs without liability. If Tesla reincorporates there, the board could decide to give Musk a \"gratitude\" bonus potentially, without having to abide by Delaware fiduciary standards. Those standards resulted in the court ruling that the company should rescind Musk's 2018 pay package.But Talley noted that a decision to reincorporate could itself be challenged by shareholders as \"a choice made for Musk-selfish reasons,\" and thus as a breach of fiduciary duty while Tesla is still subject to Delaware law.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\u2014 CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

As he often does with controversial business decisions, Musk turned to his followers on X and asked them to vote on what he should do.By Wednesday evening, Texas had won about 87% of the 1.1 million votes, and Musk said Tesla will \u201cmove immediately to hold a shareholder vote.\u201dBefore the poll closed, Abbott declared a landslide victory for Texas in a post on X, which Musk also owns.If Tesla follows through, such a move would amount to another win for a state that has used its ties with him to burnish its pro-business credentials. <-rte-company state=\"{\"_id\":\"0000018d-6530-d52b-a3af-e7f61fc30000\",\"_type\":\"00000160-4b23-d8bd-adfd-4b3348fd0000\"}\">Texas has been luring CEOs and their companies for years by touting its low taxes and light regulatory touch. Being home to Tesla\u2019s legal incorporation would dovetail with a more recent state initiative: developing its own business-court system in a challenge to Delaware.   WATCH; Elon Musk\u2019s $55 billion pay package at Tesla was struck down by a Delaware judge after a shareholder challenged it as excessive. Ed Ludlow reports. Source: Bloomberg  Trying to chip away at Delaware\u2019s dominance in the US incorporation business may be a tall order, but it\u2019s in line with Abbott\u2019s efforts to bolster economic development by offering a distinctively Texan brand of capitalism. Texas is known for business-friendly lawmakers, and it doesn\u2019t tax income or capital gains for individuals. More controversially, Texas lawmakers recently banned public universities from maintaining offices of diversity, equity and inclusion, taking on a subject that Musk has often criticized as well. The state has also sought to punish Wall Street banks for policies that limit work with gun and fossil-fuel industries, drawing a <-bsp-bb-link state=\"{\"bbDocId\":\"S3I1NLT0G1KW\",\"_id\":\"0000018d-6530-d52b-a3af-e7f61fc70004\",\"_type\":\"0000016b-944a-dc2b-ab6b-d57ba1cc0000\"}\">rebuke last year from JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Jamie Dimon, who said those moves were putting the state\u2019s business-friendly reputation at risk. Ditching Delaware and moving Tesla\u2019s legal incorporation to Texas would certainly carry risks. The First State has long been the destination of choice for companies seeking to incorporate, due to a well-developed set of corporate-governance laws and 125 years of case decisions out of state courts that provide robust protections for board directors and executives. Chancery court judges in the state are recognized as business-law experts who can hear cases on a fast-track basis. Most high-profile merger-and-acquisition disputes are litigated in Delaware in non-jury cases. Even foreign companies come to the state to have corporate disputes decided.Texas CourtsThe same hasn\u2019t been true in Texas, where business law disputes are <-bsp-bb-link state=\"{\"bbDocId\":\"RTTZ4RDWRGG0\",\"_id\":\"0000018d-6530-d52b-a3af-e7f61fc90000\",\"_type\":\"0000016b-944a-dc2b-ab6b-d57ba1cc0000\"}\">routinely pushed to make way for emergency criminal cases or family law matters. As a result, business cases sometimes take years to resolve. Moreover, the outcomes can be unpredictable, and the state courts have been known to grant huge awards for plaintiffs suing companies.In an effort to streamline such proceedings, state leaders moved last year to establish dedicated business courts in major cities. Judges will be appointed to two-year terms by the governor and have smaller dockets limited to certain business disputes. That means cases can be expedited, helping companies keep a lid on litigation costs.

The starting salary for a judge on the business courts would be $140,000. By comparison, a Delaware chancery judge starts at almost $185,000. Still, a fresh slate at newly established courts may be exactly what Musk is looking for. The billionaire has faced <-bsp-bb-link state=\"{\"bbDocId\":\"S84EYXT1UM0W\",\"_id\":\"0000018d-6530-d52b-a3af-e7f61fcb0001\",\"_type\":\"0000016b-944a-dc2b-ab6b-d57ba1cc0000\"}\">two legal setbacks in Delaware, including the latest ruling threatening his pay package. It\u2019s also where Musk gave up his efforts to back out of his $44 billion offer to buy Twitter Inc., which is now known as X. Musk moved the social-media company\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, where laws offer more protections from investor suits against executives.Growing FootprintIf Musk makes good on his threat to move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas, it would strengthen his growing footprint in the nation\u2019s second-largest state. Back in 2003, SpaceX bought land in the tiny town of McGregor, 100 miles southwest of Dallas, to test rocket engines. Over the subsequent two decades, his ties to the state have only grown.

Musk\u2019s 2021 plea for people to move there to work has transformed the city\u2019s identity to the \u201cgateway to Mars.\u201d Local establishments flaunt portraits of Musk and spaceships on merchandise, or create products like a five-pound \u201cSpaceX burger\u201d that\u2019s \u201cout of this world.\u201d New businesses are given names such as Launchpad Crossing and The Moon Rock. Political TiesMusk\u2019s political donations in Texas have been modest relative to his fortune, which is valued at $205 billion including the pay package Delaware voided. He\u2019s only given $97,000 to candidates in the state since 2010, according to Texas Ethics Commission records. In his largest contributions, he made $10,000 donations in 2014 to Dan Patrick\u2019s campaign for lieutenant governor and to Joe Straus, then the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. Musk\u2019s last political donation came in 2016, and he\u2019s never donated to Abbott. After the governor said in 2021 that Musk \u201clikes the social policies in Texas,\u201d Musk said on social media that he \u201cwould prefer to stay out of politics.\u201d More recently, though, the two have had a warmer relationship on X. Less than a day after Abbott\u2019s tweet this week urging Musk to incorporate Tesla in Texas, the governor posted a patriotic drawing of the state saying \u201cStand With Texas\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to its standoff with the federal government over immigration enforcement on the border.

Instead, his pay package is based on goals tied to the company's financial growth.Under the terms of the package, Musk would be granted stock equivalent to 1% of Tesla's outstanding shares whenever he met the 12 tranches of growth targets.The ruling in Delaware could threaten Musk's title as the world's richest person, given that most of his wealth is tied to his equity in Tesla.Advertisement\"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X on Tuesday.Musk appears to have a strong affinity for the Lone Star State.

A survey of hundreds of business executives conducted by Fortune just ranked Musk as America's most overrated CEO. Fortune published the survey results on Wednesday after asking hundreds of CEOs to rank their most overrated and underrated peers. Fortune did not specify exactly how many CEOs had responded to the survey.Musk, who was also named the most overrated CEO in last year's survey, received 399 votes this year. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who came in second with 302 votes.Microsoft chief Satya Nadella was ranked the most underrated CEO, receiving 274 votes. Nadella has held the title for eight consecutive years.Musk maintains a busy schedule running multiple companies, from electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla to the rocket company SpaceX. In 2022, Musk purchased the social media platform Twitter, which he later renamed X.AdvertisementWhile Musk has been hailed for revolutionizing the electric vehicle and commercial space industries, the billionaire has also been criticized for setting overly ambitious targets.Musk has repeatedly pushed back SpaceX's timeline for sending humans to Mars. In 2017, Musk claimed that SpaceX would send its first crewed mission to Mars in 2024.Then, in 2021, Musk pushed the projected date to 2026. He later told a user on X in 2022 that people would probably reach Mars in 2029.Representatives for Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.

He would almost certainly face investor lawsuits, particularly if it was seen as a move to secure his pay package, legal experts said.\"Shareholders need to take a hard look at how transitioning out of Delaware might impact their rights and the company's governance,\" Independent business adviser Keith Donovan said.There could also be some dispute over the level of support Musk would need to change Tesla's governing rules for the move.Some specific changes require two-thirds of shareholders to back. If Tesla were to adopt a Texas charter that did not change the provisions that require a super majority, it would likely be able to move to Texas with a simple majority, said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane University Law School.It would take at least 40 to 60 days to organize a shareholder vote, although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could slow the process by requiring additional disclosures, she said.Tesla shares closed about 1% higher on Thursday. After more than doubling in 2023, the stock has lost roughly a quarter of its value this year due to growing concerns of soft EV demand.The ruling is not the first time that Musk has suffered a setback in Delaware.Story continuesMcCormick was the same judge who oversaw Twitter's July 2022 lawsuit against Musk after he tried to back out of his contract to buy the social media platform for $44 billion. The judge rejected his delaying tactics and Musk finally went through with the deal.\"Musk must believe that Texas judges are more 'business friendly' than their Delaware counterparts... Musk must be assuming that Texas judges will...take a more relaxed approach to the issue than Delaware judges,\" said Brian Cheffins, a professor of corporate law at Cambridge University.\"It is far from clear Texas judges will do so.\"More than 65% of Fortune 500 companies and over half of all U.S. publicly traded companies are incorporated in Delaware, lured by the state's business-friendly legal framework and tax policies, according to Harvard Business Services, a firm offering Delaware business formation services.U.S. public companies look to incorporate in Delaware for access to the state's courts. Its corporate law places greater restraints on management and is more protective of investors than states like Nevada, making it cheaper for Delaware companies to raise capital.TripAdvisor and its parent company are currently defending a lawsuit by their shareholders, who have challenged the company's plans to re-incorporate in Nevada from Delaware.MUSK AND LONE STARMusk has also recently said he would be uncomfortable growing the automaker to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics without at least 25% voting control of the company, which is nearly double his current stake.\"\"What's more concerning is he has a lot of AI efforts in Tesla, and if he doesn't get his way with his pay package, what will he do in terms of those efforts diminishing in Tesla and going somewhere else?\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at shareholder Globalt Investments.Musk has more than a small interest in Texas.He shifted Tesla's corporate headquarters to the state from California in 2021 after criticizing California's regulations and taxes, and clashing with health officials at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic over reopening a factory in Fremont.One of the EV maker's gigafactories is in Texas, where it is also planning an over $750 million expansion. It is also building a lithium refinery in the state, aiming to produce enough for about 1 million EVs by 2025.Musk's other companies - SpaceX and The Boring Company - also have operations in Texas.Musk, like in the past, held a poll on X, and proclaimed that the 87% \"yes\" vote out of 1.1 million total votes was a deciding factor.\"The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,\" Musk said on X.(Reporting by Maria Ponnezhath, Shubham Kalia, Samrhitha Arunasalam and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Tom Hals in Wilmington and Martin Coulter in London; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Sayantani Ghosh and Arun Koyyur)TRENDING 1.

Why a Delaware judge struck down Tesla CEO's $55 billion payday Jessica GuynnUSA TODAYIs Elon Musk overpaid?A Delaware judge this week voided the $55.8 billion Tesla pay package that helped make Musk the world\u2019s richest person, calling it an \u201cunfathomable sum\u201d that was unfair to shareholders.Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled Tuesday that Tesla\u2019s board of directors failed to show that the pay package for the electric car company's CEO was fair to shareholders.The defendants had the burden of \"proving the fairness of the largest potential compensation plan in the history of public markets,\" McCormick said in the 200-page ruling. \"The task proved too tall an order.So what happens next?Why did the Delaware judge void Elon Musk's pay package?The lawsuit was filed by a shareholder who claimed that Musk had close ties with the Tesla board and too much say in negotiations.\u00a0Musk and Tesla argued that making sure Musk continued to lead the company was critical to its future and that the deal made concessions to shareholders.\u00a0\"In addition to his 21.9% equity stake, Musk was the paradigmatic 'Superstar CEO,' who held some of the most influential corporate positions (CEO, Chair, and founder), enjoyed thick ties with the directors tasked with negotiating on behalf of Tesla, and dominated the process that led to board approval of his compensation plan,\" the judge said. \"At least as to this transaction, Musk controlled Tesla.\"What will the Tesla board do?Tesla board members now face a \u201ctornado situation,\u201d according to Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.They must negotiate a new pay package that has the approval of shareholders and of Musk, who recently demanded an increase in his ownership stake in the company, appeal the judge\u2019s decision or change where Tesla is incorporated.How did Elon Musk react to the Delaware ruling?On X, the social media platform that he owns, he asked his followers to vote if Tesla should incorporate in Texas, a more business-friendly state where it has its corporate offices and a factory.\u201cI recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,\u201d he wrote.Case Western Reserve University law professor Anat Alon-Beck said Musk only has himself to blame for ignoring the fundamentals of the fairness doctrine and failing to show that the pay package was inherently fair to shareholders.\u00a0\u201cThese are basic principles he could have \u2013 and should have \u2013 been coached on Delaware corporate law,\u201d Alon-Beck said. \u201cMusk just didn\u2019t follow the corporate rules and procedures. If he did, he would have avoided this mess.\u201dHow much Tesla stock does Elon Musk own?Even without the stock from the pay package, Musk owns about 411 million Tesla shares, worth approximately $78 billion.\u2018Absurd\u2019 Elon Musk pay package criticizedThe court decision comes as the compensation of rank-and-file employees lags big bumps in executive pay.\u00a0The judge said Musk\u2019s pay package was \u201cthe largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets by multiple orders of magnitude\u201d \u2013 250 times larger than the median compensation plans of his peers and more than 33 times larger than the plan\u2019s closest comparison, which was Musk\u2019s prior pay package.\u201cMusk\u2019s absurd 2018 pay package eviscerated the previous CEO compensation record by orders of magnitude at a time when CEO compensation already insulted any sense of what a senior manager is truly worth,\u201d Bart Naylor, financial policy advocate for Public Citizen, said in a statement.Featured Weekly AdAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Request a Correction Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Help Center Manage Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop USA TODAY Print Editions Licensing & Reprints Advertise With Us Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Submitting letters to the editor Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X Instagram LinkedIn Threads Post YouTube Reddit Flipboard10Best Reviewed Best-selling Booklist Jobs Sports Betting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett Classifieds Coupons Homefront Home Internet Blueprint Auto Insurance Pet Insurance Travel Insurance Credit Cards Banking Personal Loans LLC Formation Payroll Software\u00a9 2024 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.", "SpaceX's Giant Starship Tapped to Launch Starlab's Giant Steel Space StationThe A.V.

Image: Voyager SpaceStarlab Space\u2019s forthcoming space station is so big and heavy that only the formidable SpaceX Starship megarocket can launch it into orbit, but the one-time delivery option comes with distinct benefits.Astronomers Could Soon Get Warnings When SpaceX Satellites Threaten Their ViewCCShare SubtitlesOffEnglishShare this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoAstronomers Could Soon Get Warnings When SpaceX Satellites Threaten Their ViewStarlab Space, like several other commercial ventures, is racing to deliver a commercial space station to orbit in anticipation of the International Space Station\u2019s retirement in 2030. The company, a joint venture between Colorado-based Voyager Space and Europe\u2019s Airbus, announced on Wednesday that it has secured a launch provider for the mission\u2014and it\u2019s a company you may have heard of.AdvertisementIt\u2019s SpaceX, of course. The Elon Musk-led aerospace firm will use its Starship megarocket for the required lifting duties owing to the anticipated size and weight of the space station, eponymously named Starlab. \u201cSpaceX\u2019s history of success and reliability led our team to select Starship to orbit Starlab,\u201d Dylan Taylor, chairman and CEO of Voyager Space, said in a statement, adding that \u201cStarlab will be launched to orbit in a single flight by Starship.\u201dRelated article: Voyager Space and Airbus to Collaborate on Commercial Successor to the ISSBig rockets allow you to do big things. In this case, they make it possible to deliver a 26-foot-wide (eight-meter) space station built from stainless steel. Manfred Jaumann, vice president of low Earth orbit and suborbital programs at Airbus, disclosed these specifications at a German tech expo this past November, saying Starlab will be too large and heavy for any launch vehicles currently in service or being developed, save for Starship, as SpaceNews reports. Starlab\u2019s exact weight is not yet known. But Starship, also made from stainless steel (I\u2019m sensing a fetish here), has an anticipated lift capacity of 150 metric tons to low Earth orbit, a destination otherwise known as LEO. AdvertisementOf course, Starship is not yet ready for prime time. The megarocket has performed two test flights to date, with a third planned in February. Pinpointing an exact timeframe for the rocket\u2019s operational flight certification is difficult given its highly experimental nature. Powered by 33 Raptor engines, this two-stage rocket is the largest and most powerful ever constructed and is designed for full reusability.AdvertisementStarlab, set to reach LEO in 2028, will be fully equipped on the ground for fuss-free operations, eliminating the need for space assembly, thus saving time and costs. As Voyager Space president Matt Kuta told Payload: \u201cIt cannot be understated, the significance of the single launch to orbit, not two-three-four launches, to close the business plan.\u201d AdvertisementOnce operational, Starlab will continually house a crew of four astronauts conducting a range of experiments. Utilizing its orbital position, these experiments will take advantage of conditions like microgravity and exposure to the radioactive space environment. Starlab Space intends to use this station to cater to space agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), various researchers, and commercial companies.Over the last year, the Starlab team has achieved key milestones such as Systems Requirements and Definition Reviews, along with Human in the Loop testing. The company  is planning collaborations with ESA, Hilton Hotels, and The Ohio State University. Starlab Space has undergone significant changes recently; Lockheed Martin has been replaced by Northrop Grumman, which will provide its autonomous Cygnus spacecraft for cargo missions.

Greg Abbott.AdvertisementNow Musk is threatening to shift Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas from Delaware after a judge in the tiny state voided his $55 billion compensation package. As he often does with controversial business decisions, Musk turned to his followers on X and asked them to vote on what he should do.AdvertisementBy Wednesday afternoon, Texas had won about 87% of the 1 million votes, with five hours to go in the survey.Business BriefingBecome a business insider with the latest news.SIGN UPOr with: GoogleFacebookBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy PolicyShould Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 31, 2024\u201cElon, it\u2019s over,\u201d Abbott said in a post on X, which Musk also owns. \u201cThe election desk is declaring a landslide victory for Texas.\u201dAdvertisementIf Musk follows through, such a move would amount to another win for a state that has used its ties with him to burnish its pro-business credentials. Texas has been luring CEOs and their companies for years by touting its low taxes and light regulatory touch. Being home to Tesla\u2019s legal incorporation would dovetail with a more recent state initiative: developing its own business-court system in a challenge to Delaware.Trying to chip away at Delaware\u2019s dominance in the U.S. incorporation business may be a tall order, but it\u2019s in line with Abbott\u2019s efforts to bolster economic development by offering a distinctively Texan brand of capitalism. Texas is known for business-friendly lawmakers, and it doesn\u2019t tax income or capital gains for individuals.Related:Elon Musk book: Tesla pondered Dallas for gigafactory but dismissed it as \u2018too Texas\u2019AdvertisementMore controversially, Texas lawmakers recently banned public universities from maintaining offices of diversity, equity and inclusion, taking on a subject that Musk has often criticized as well. The state has also sought to punish Wall Street banks for policies that limit work with gun and fossil-fuel industries, drawing a rebuke last year from JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Jamie Dimon, who said those moves were putting the state\u2019s business-friendly reputation at risk.AdvertisementDitching Delaware and moving Tesla\u2019s legal incorporation to Texas would certainly carry risks. The First State has long been the destination of choice for companies seeking to incorporate, due to a well-developed set of corporate-governance laws and 125 years of case decisions out of state courts that provide robust protections for board directors and executives.Chancery court judges in the state are recognized as business-law experts who can hear cases on a fast-track basis. Most high-profile merger-and-acquisition disputes are litigated in Delaware in non-jury cases. Even foreign companies come to the state to have corporate disputes decided.Austin, where Tesla built a massive electric vehicle manufacturing plant, is the physical headquarters of the company. (Tom Fox)AdvertisementTexas courtsThe same hasn\u2019t been true in Texas, where business law disputes are routinely pushed to make way for emergency criminal cases or family law matters. As a result, business cases sometimes take years to resolve. Moreover, the outcomes can be unpredictable, and the state courts have been known to grant huge awards for plaintiffs suing companies.In an effort to streamline such proceedings, state leaders moved last year to establish dedicated business courts in major cities. Judges will be appointed to two-year terms by the governor and have smaller dockets limited to certain business disputes. That means cases can be expedited, helping companies keep a lid on litigation costs.The courts won\u2019t open until September, and much about how they will operate has yet to be established. Moreover, Texas is struggling to recruit judges with 10 or more years of experience in complex civil business litigation due to its refusal to boost pay. The starting salary for a judge on the business courts would be $140,000. By comparison, a Delaware chancery judge starts at almost $185,000.AdvertisementStill, a fresh slate at newly established courts may be exactly what Musk is looking for. The billionaire has faced two legal setbacks in Delaware, including the latest ruling threatening his pay package. It\u2019s also where Musk gave up his efforts to back out of his $44 billion offer to buy Twitter Inc., which is now known as X.Musk moved the social-media company\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, where laws offer more protections from investor suits against executives.Boca Chica, on the Texas-Mexico border, is where Musk is building a SpaceX Starbase. (Smiley N. Pool / Staff Photographer)Growing footprintIf Musk makes good on his threat to move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas, it would strengthen his growing footprint in the nation\u2019s second-largest state. Back in 2003, SpaceX bought land in the tiny town of McGregor, 100 miles southwest of Dallas, to test rocket engines. Over the subsequent two decades, his ties to the state have only grown.AdvertisementHe\u2019s moved his charitable foundation and his right-hand man, Jared Birchall, to the state since the start of the pandemic. Birchall is listed on about a dozen limited liability companies registered in Texas since the start of 2020, according to public records.Musk\u2019s latest nonprofit endeavor is a new school with eventual plans for a university in Austin, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service. He\u2019s also planning a 100-person office in the state capital to help enforce content and safety rules on X.In addition, he has planted his flag in Boca Chica at the southern tip of Texas along the US-Mexico border, where SpaceX is building a massive deep-space rocket called Starship.

He\u2019s only given $97,000 to candidates in the state since 2010, according to Texas Ethics Commission records.In his largest contributions, he made $10,000 donations in 2014 to Dan Patrick\u2019s campaign for lieutenant governor and to Joe Straus, then the speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. Musk\u2019s last political donation came in 2016, and he\u2019s never donated to Abbott.AdvertisementAfter the governor said in 2021 that Musk \u201clikes the social policies in Texas,\u201d Musk said on social media that he \u201cwould prefer to stay out of politics.\u201dMore recently, though, the two have had a warmer relationship on X. Less than a day after Abbott\u2019s tweet this week urging Musk to incorporate Tesla in Texas, the governor posted a patriotic drawing of the state saying \u201cStand With Texas\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to its standoff with the federal government over immigration enforcement on the border.Musk replied by saying \u201cYes!\u201dMadlin Mekelburg, Sophie Alexander, Jef Feeley, Bill Allison, Dana Hull and Loren Grush, BloombergBloomberg Wirenewsfeedback+wireservices@dallasnews.com AdvertisementAdvertisementTop Business StoriesOncor boosts infrastructure spending to $24 billion as Texas population, demand grows Member ExclusiveAmerican Airlines closes in on major order tilted toward AirbusHilton Anatole unveils over $30 million in renovationsSprawling ranch west of Fort Worth hits market with $39.1 million pricetagMember ExclusiveDallas-area home prices rise over 2% in latest measureMember ExclusiveAdvertisementTDMNTexas' Leading News SourceEst.

What Happens Next?The company\u2019s board will now decide whether to appeal the decision, change where Tesla is incorporated or negotiate a new pay package.Share full articleLawyers for Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, could try to appeal the decision, but legal experts said the chances of success were slim.Credit...Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersBy Jack Ewing and Peter EavisJan. 31, 2024A Delaware judge\u2019s decision to void the pay package that helped make Elon Musk the world\u2019s richest person leaves Tesla\u2019s board with some difficult decisions to make.Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery on Tuesday ordered Tesla to cancel stock options awarded to Mr. Musk, the electric car company\u2019s chief executive, worth about $50 billion. Now the company\u2019s directors must figure out a new compensation plan that can pass legal muster and satisfy Mr. Musk, who recently demanded that the board substantially increase his ownership of Tesla.Tesla and Mr. Musk could appeal the court decision. Mr. Musk on Thursday said he would seek to incorporate the company in Texas, a state that he believes could be more hospitable to businesses. What happens to Mr. Musk\u2019s stock options?As part of a compensation package Tesla finalized in 2018, Mr. Musk received options to buy 304 million shares that are now worth more than $50 billion. He has met the goals needed to receive those options, but Mr. Musk does not appear to have converted them into shares of Tesla. If he had, he would be barred from selling them for five years.Chancellor McCormick said in her decision that Tesla must cancel the options, although she has not yet issued a formal order requiring the company to do so.Even without the stock from that package, Tesla has made Mr. Musk unimaginably rich. He owns roughly 411 million Tesla shares that are worth around $78 billion. A securities filing last year said he had pledged 238 million shares for personal loans.Can Tesla just pack up and leave Delaware?Mr. Musk, clearly angry, threatened to reincorporate Tesla in another state. On X, the social media platform that he owns, he said on Thursday that Tesla \u201cwill immediately move to hold a shareholder vote\u201d to incorporate itself in Texas, where it has its corporate offices and a large factory.Delaware is a popular place for companies to incorporate because of its streamlined legal system. Cases are heard by judges instead of juries, and there is only one layer of appeal \u2014 to the Delaware Supreme Court.Mr. Musk has incorporated X, his social media company, in Nevada, whose laws make it much harder to sue directors. That company, previously called Twitter, had been incorporated in Delaware before Mr. Musk acquired it.But his plan to move Tesla to Texas might meet resistance from shareholders if they see the change as an attempt to reduce their power.Relocation \u201cdoesn\u2019t give him a magic ticket,\u201d said Gregory Varallo, a lawyer in Wilmington, Del., who argued the case against Mr. Musk\u2019s pay package for shareholders.How might Tesla\u2019s stock react?If the stock options Tesla had awarded Mr. Musk in the 2018 package are voided, the company would have fewer shares outstanding. That, in theory, would increase the value of the stock owned by other people or businesses.But any lift this gives the stock price could be offset by investor fears that Mr. Musk might leave the company or become less focused on its operations. Tesla\u2019s share price fell by about 2 percent on Wednesday after Ms. McCormick\u2019s ruling, which was released after the stock market had closed on Tuesday.Over the long term, a company\u2019s share price is driven by its profit and cash flow. Tesla\u2019s stock has slumped by more than half from its high and is down over 20 percent this year largely because its profit margins have plunged and the company is expecting sales to grow much more slowly this year.What can the Tesla board do?Chancellor McCormick said Mr. Musk played too great a role in devising the terms of his pay deal, and the board, which is legally obligated to serve the best interests of all shareholders, was not sufficiently independent of him. One director is his brother, Kimbal, and several others are longstanding friends and associates. She also said the pay package was excessive and paid him much more than was needed to motivate him to do a good job.As a result, directors might have to make changes that will convince a judge that any new compensation package they award him was put together in an arms-length negotiation between them and Mr. Musk. Any revamped pay deal might also have to pay him a lot less.The Tesla board needs to find a way to keep Mr. Musk focused on the business while also exerting more control over his \u201cerratic\u201d behavior, said Kristin Hull, founder of Nia Impact Capital, an investment firm in Oakland, Calif.\u201cWe want him to play a really important role,\u201d Dr. Hull said, but added, \u201cThere need to be some checks and balances and that\u2019s what this decision is all about.\u201d The fund owns a small number of shares.Robyn Denholm, the chair of Tesla\u2019s board, did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the other seven members of the board.Can Mr. Musk fight the decision?Tesla and Mr. Musk can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, which some legal experts said would probably uphold the ruling.But some legal experts said lawyers for the company and Mr. Musk could try to argue that Ms. McCormick\u2019s ruling went too far and should be reversed. Mr. Musk\u2019s lawyers, for instance, might argue that he was not the controlling shareholder that Chancellor McCormick suggested he was. He owned about 22 percent of Tesla when the package was devised, not giving him enough votes to control the company. The chancellor also said his \u201csuperstar\u201d status gave him undue influence on the board.\u201cThe supreme court could go either way\u201d on that argument, said Michal Barzuza, a law professor at the University of Virginia, referring to the Delaware Supreme Court.Tesla could also seek to take its appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but might have a tough time getting the high court to take the case because it does not raise any obvious constitutional or federal issues.Lawyers who represented Mr. Musk in the case did not respond to requests for comment.What does this mean for Tesla as a company?The decision would change Tesla\u2019s approach to designing, manufacturing and selling cars only if it prompts Mr. Musk to leave the company or play a less active role. Mr. Musk has shown signs of being restive. Before the decision, Mr. Musk had demanded that the Tesla board increase his stake in the company to 25 percent, from 13 percent.If he didn\u2019t get what he was asking for, he said, he would work on robotics and artificial intelligence products elsewhere. Mr. Musk has already established an independent artificial intelligence company called xAI. He also runs SpaceX and is the founder of Neuralink, which is developing implants allowing people to control computers with their brains.It\u2019s hard to see how the Tesla board could meet his demand for a much bigger stake in the car company in light of the Delaware decision.Few, if any, chief executives are so closely identified with their products, or seen as such an essential part of their companies\u2019 success, as Mr. Musk. In her decision, Ms. McCormick suggested his status as a \u201csuperstar\u201d chief executive had a downside. It \u201ccreates a \u2018distortion field\u2019 that interferes with board oversight,\u201d she said.Jack Ewing writes about the auto industry with an emphasis on electric vehicles.
