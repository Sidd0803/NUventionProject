The 71-year-old Russian leader spent more than 20 minutes showering a baffled Carlson with dates and names going back to the ninth century.Putin even gave him a folder containing what he said were copies of historical documents proving his points: that Ukrainians and Russians historically have always been one people, and that Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty is merely an illegitimate holdover from the Soviet era.

(AP Photo, File)Carlson said he was \u201cshocked\u201d at being on the receiving end of the history lesson. But for those familiar with Putin\u2019s government, it was not surprising in the least: In Russia, history has long been a propaganda tool used to advance the Kremlin\u2019s political goals. And the last two years have been entirely in keeping with that ethos. In an effort to rally people around their world view, Russian authorities have tried to magnify the country\u2019s past victories while glossing over the more sordid chapters of its history. They have rewritten textbooks, funded sprawling historical exhibitions and suppressed \u2014 sometimes harshly \u2014 voices that contradict their narrative. Russian officials have also regularly bristled at Ukraine and other European countries for pulling down Soviet monuments, widely seen there as an unwanted legacy of past oppression, and even put scores of European officials on a wanted list over that in a move that made headlines this month. \u201cIn the hands of the authorities,\u201d says Oleg Orlov, co-founder of Memorial, Russia\u2019s oldest and most prominent rights group, \u201chistory has become a hammer \u2014 or even an axe.\u201d THE GLORIFYING From the early years of his quarter-century rule, Putin has repeatedly contended that studying their history should make Russians proud. Even controversial figures, such as Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, contributed to Russia\u2019s greatness, Putin argues.

But that idea, criticized heavily by historians, didn\u2019t gain much traction for quite a while \u2014 until Russia invaded Ukraine.

Grade 11. A basic level\", in Tallinn, Estonia, Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2024.(AP Photo)Last year, the government rolled out a series of four new \u201cuniversal\u201d history textbooks for 10th- and 11th-graders. One featured a chapter on Moscow\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, blamed the West for the Cold War and described the collapse of the Soviet Union as \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\u201d Some historians derided it as blatant propaganda. \u201cThe Soviet Union, and later Russia, is (depicted in the textbook as) always a besieged fortress, which constantly lives surrounded by enemies. These hostile circles are trying to weaken Russia in every conceivable way and seize its resources,\u201d says historian Nikita Sokolov. The Kremlin-friendly vision of Russian history is also dominating a chain of sprawling, state-funded \u201chistory parks\u201d \u2013 venues that host history-themed exhibitions in 24 cities across the country.                    MORE FROM RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR                For many Ukrainians, life is split in two: Before and after the war.

Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov), a Russian Orthodox bishop reported to be Putin\u2019s personal confessor, was the driving force behind them. Packed with animations, touch-screen displays and other flashy elements, those widely popular expositions were criticized by historians for inaccurate claims and deliberate glorification of Russian rulers and their conquests. One exhibition described Ivan the Terrible, a 16th-century Russian czar known for his violent purges of Russian nobility, as a victim of \u201can information war.\u201d Another was widely advertised with a quote falsely attributed to Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of the German Empire in the 19th century, that was removed swiftly after sparking outcry: \u201cIt is impossible to defeat the Russians. We have seen this ourselves over hundreds of years. But Russians can be instilled with false values, and then they will defeat themselves.\u201d Moscow students dressed in the fashion of the middle of the last century and Soviet style uniform perform \u201cVictory Waltz\u201d as a part of Victory Day celebration in front of the historical main gates of VDNKh, The Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, with the red star in the background in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, May 6, 2023. (AP Photo, File)Central to this narrative of an invincible Russia is the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Marked on May 9 \u2014 Germany officially capitulated after midnight Moscow time on May 9, 1945 \u2014 the Soviet victory has become integral to Russian identity. The Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people in the war, pushing German forces from Stalingrad, deep inside Russia, all the way to Berlin. The suffering and valor that went into the German defeat have been touchstones ever since, and under Putin Victory Day has become the country\u2019s primary secular holiday.For the authorities, \u201cRussia\u2019s history is a road from one victory to the next,\u201d sums up Orlov, whose group won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. \u201cAnd more beautiful victories lie ahead. And (the Kremlin says that) we must be proud of our history; history is a means of instilling patriotism. Of course in their view, patriotism is appreciation of the leadership \u2013 be it the leadership of the czarist Russia, the leadership of the Soviet Russia or the current leadership.\u201dTHE SILENCINGAs celebrations of Victory Day over the years grew more imperious, Putin\u2019s government grew less tolerant of any questioning or criticism of the Soviet Union\u2019s actions in that war \u2014 or generally. In 2014, Russian cable networks dropped Dozhd, the county\u2019s sole independent TV channel, after it hosted a history program on the 1941-44 Siege of Leningrad and asked viewers to vote on whether Soviet authorities should have surrendered Leningrad to save lives. Famine in the city, now called St. Petersburg, killed more than 500,000 people during the siege. The question caused an uproar, with officials accusing the channel of crossing moral and ethical lines. People attend the Immortal Regiment march through the main street toward Red Square marking the 77th anniversary of the end of World War II, in Moscow, Russia, Monday, May 9, 2022. (AP Photo/Denis Tyrin, File)That same year, the Russian government adopted a law that made \u201crehabilitating Nazism\u201d \u2013 or \u201cspreading knowingly false information about the actions of the USSR during World War II\u201d \u2013 a criminal offense. The first conviction on those charges was reported in 2016. A man was fined 200,000 rubles (about $3,000 at the time) for a social media post saying that \u201cthe Communists and Germany attacked Poland together, unleashing World War II.\u201d In the years that followed, the number of convictions on the charge only grew.Research and public debate about mass repressions by Stalin also have faced significant resistance in recent years. Historians and rights advocates cite the inevitable parallels to the current crackdown against dissent that has already landed hundreds of people behind bars. Two historians involved in researching Stalin\u2019s mass executions in northwestern Russia were jailed in recent years \u2013 prosecutions on unrelated charges many link to their work. Memorial, Russia\u2019s oldest and most prominent human rights group that drew international acclaim for its studies of political repression in the Soviet Union, has been shut down. It continues to work, but its activities in Russia have been significantly curtailed. And a queue of people waiting for their turn to read out the names of victims of Soviet repressions no longer snakes through central Moscow streets in late October. The tradition to read them aloud once a year in front of a monument to victims of Soviet repressions \u2014 called \u201cReturning the Names\u201d \u2014 was started in 2007 and once attracted thousands of people. In 2020, Moscow authorities stopped authorizing it, citing COVID-19.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File)The authorities are threatened by efforts to preserve historical memory, and it has gotten worse since the war in Ukraine began, says Natalya Baryshnikova, producer of last year\u2019s \u201cReturning the Names,\u201d which in 2023 went ahead in dozens of cities abroad and online.\u201cWe see this very clearly\u201d since the Ukraine war began, says Baryshnikova. \u201cAny grassroots civil movement or statement about the memory of Soviet terror is inconvenient.\u201dTHE JUSTIFYINGAccording to prominent history teacher Tamara Eidelman, the historical narrative the Kremlin is trying to impose on society contains several main elements: the primacy of the state, the affairs of which are always more important than individual lives; the cult of self-sacrifice and readiness to give up one\u2019s life for a greater cause; and the cult of war. \u201cOf course, (the latter) is never explicitly spelled out,\u201d Eidelman says. Instead, the narrative is: \u201c`We have always strived for peace \u2026 We have always been attacked and merely fought back.\u2019\u201dThat laid the perfect ideological groundwork for the invasion of Ukraine, she says, and points out how the \u201cNever again!\u201d sentiment about World War II for some in Russia in recent years became \u201cWe can do it again\u201d \u2014 a popular slogan after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 as the Kremlin adopted increasingly aggressive rhetoric toward the West.

Russians seem to like to kill the defenseless and helpless. They can\u2019t do it at the front \u2014 there they have been repelled \u2014 so in the middle of the night, they launch missiles at maternity hospitals, high-rise buildings, train stations, metro stations, schools, libraries.The worst thing during the attacks is the endless messages we send one another. The stupidest of the stupid is the question \u201cHow are you?\u201d That question flies above Kyiv, Odesa, Kherson, Dnipro, gathering replies. \u201cIt fell close.\u201d \u201cI see a fire.\u201d \u201cWe are fine but it is burning somewhere here.\u201d \u201cThe house across from us is no more.\u201d \u201cThe smell of death, my Anya said it smells like death.\u201d Yet there is no alternative. It is a question that, for all its ridiculousness, cannot be left unanswered. Silence means misfortune and death.We, the people of a decade of war, are used to those. The world is talking of a second anniversary. Wrong: The war has not been two years but 10, from when Russian forces annexed Crimea and invaded the Donbas. Calling it an anniversary isn\u2019t quite right, either. In Ukrainian, the period of time equivalent to a year is defined by two words: \u201crichnytsia\u201d (anniversary) and \u201crokovyny\u201d (commemoration). \u201cRokovyny\u201d often refers to memorial services, while \u201crichnytsia\u201d pertains more to celebrating life. So much sorrow has settled in our memory and calendars that everything is a memorial now.Yet despite all the \u201crokovyny\u201d in Ukraine across the centuries \u2014 the Baturyn massacre in the 18th century and the Valuev and Ems decrees in the 19th century, the executions in Bykivnia and Sandarmokh and the Holodomor under Soviet rule, the murder of the Heavenly Hundred in 2014 and the recent devastation of Bucha, Bakhmut and the Kakhovka dam \u2014 we\u2019re still here. We are still fighting for \u201crichnytsias,\u201d for anniversaries and jubilees of our victory.In these most recent years of war, a lot has changed. In Mariupol, there was a community center called Halabuda \u2014 a place where Japanese and computer literacy were taught, where book launches and concerts were held, where people learned to be businessmen and proactive citizens, where they painted, sang and developed projects for an environmentally friendly city. After a brutal monthslong siege led to the Russian capture of the city in the spring of 2022, Halabuda had to relocate. Today in Cherkasy, a city in central Ukraine, it\u2019s where people repair drones.There\u2019s so much more left unrealized. More destinies that played out as heroic in war, but whose bearers can no longer do the things they may have been fated to: write books, open restaurants or discover a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Their smiles now exist only in photographs.Among the things that have changed, perhaps, is the desire to tell the world what the Russians have done and are doing to Ukrainians, in the past and today. It used to be so vivid, so resonant, creating a second self for me \u2014 a self with stories of slain friends and photos of mass burials, along with a firm conviction that every death, every sorrow must be told, documented and avenged.That feeling is gone. There are still the stories, photos and convictions. But I don\u2019t want to tell the world about it anymore. The world is literate. It has access to the internet, to the news; it can see everything itself. I am grateful to the thousands, perhaps millions of people to whom we don\u2019t have to explain or show anything anymore. They simply stood by us in Lithuania and Australia, Britain and Norway, the United States and Morocco, Japan and Estonia. I was lucky enough to know some of them by name. I was lucky enough to meet them \u2014 fearless and kind people \u2014 in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and even in places where the front line is a kilometer away.On the other hand, nothing has changed, not really. We have the same sense of clarity that we had in 2014. The same faith, the same love, the same rage. Do I want to go back to my prewar self, the one I was in 2013? No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to find myself back among the lies about \u201cone people\u201d from which genocide, war and murder will sprout again. I do not want to be back in the time when Russia\u2019s attack was inevitable. I want us to win and there to be no war.I think a lot about how in the first months of 2022, we might not have survived. It was my greatest fear. But the experience of those unnoticed war years, when Ukrainians fought Russian-backed forces in the country\u2019s east, kicked in. It provided me with the strength, people and ability to be resilient, to withstand. I fled Donetsk in 2014. I decided I wouldn\u2019t run anymore in 2022. I have never felt better. I have never been and will never be better than in those first months of the full-scale onslaught on Kyiv. In the words of the poet Serhiy Zhadan: \u201cTo be a sunflower in the fields of Donbas is to know how to live and what to die for.\u201d I was a sunflower on the streets of Kyiv.This year brought a new fear. I thought about the weapons we so desperately lack today. I started to wonder whether they are being given to us slowly not in an attempt to forestall Russia\u2019s total defeat, as some have thought, but simply because they do not exist. \u201cAnd what if they really don\u2019t have it?\u201d I asked my friend who is a warrior. \u201cThen it\u2019s the same as now,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe stand. We fight. We endure.\u201d My warrior friend knows how to calm me down. Before the war, he was an accountant. Now he is an artilleryman. And a bit of a philosopher.We all try to stand up for ourselves. It means different things to different people. For some, it\u2019s holding the front line. It\u2019s weaving kilometers-long camouflage nets, tirelessly evacuating the wounded, donating every bit of money to the military. For others, it\u2019s teaching children, baking bread, taking care of abandoned animals, telling jokes. Whatever we do, we are all standing up for ourselves right now, when we have a chance to escape from the occupier\u2019s boot forever. To be free, to be alive. Now, when our chance to exist as a political nation, as a community, as a state, is equal to victory in war.We are not just fighting for ourselves. We are fighting for a world in which it is safe to live. Is it appropriate at this point to ask for more weapons? We desperately need them. We need more weapons to prevent children\u2019s literature from becoming literature for the dead; to avoid having graveyards filled with dead poets, dead villagers, dead engineers; to prevent cemeteries from replacing cities or Russian missiles from targeting our hospitals, schools and homes. We need support because despite emerging from 10 years of war stronger, better and wiser, we are only human.Olena Stiazhkina is a historian and the author of \u201cCecil the Lion Had to Die,\u201d among other books.

Fighting over the following eight years resulted in the death of over 3,000 people, the displacement of more than 850,000 others and left almost 3 million Ukrainians in need of humanitarian assistance.An IRC client explains, \u201cPeople have not been able to return home for 10 years, like me and my child. We have been wandering around strange corners for 10 years now, changing schools, moving.\u201dOn 24 February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine. The two-year mark of the invasion is a powerful reminder that the impact of this war transcends the immediate events of 2022, encompassing a prolonged period of hardship for those affected.\u00a0Russian attacks continue to leave millions without access to heat, electricity, water, or\u00a0sanitation for extended periods of time. The IRC operates in the most challenging regions of Ukraine, providing assistance to those in need.\u00a0A Ukrainian mother and daughter meet at the Medyka border crossing in Poland in early March 2022.Photo: Francesco Pistilli for IRCHow is the war in Ukraine affecting civilians?Ukrainian civilians are disproportionately shouldering the devastating consequences of the war. Two years of full-scale invasion have displaced almost 10 million Ukrainians and left approximately one-third\u00a0of the population in need of humanitarian support inside the country. Many families have been displaced several times over.For the majority of Ukrainians, ordinary life remains out of reach. Schools, hospitals, and homes have been devastated by missile strikes. Access to essential services is diminished, and many Ukrainians have endured harsh winter months with limited resources.Ukraine\u2019s humanitarian needs remain immenseSome 14.6 million Ukrainians will need humanitarian assistance in 2024, including the 3.7 million people who are internally displaced.About one third of the population - including 1.5 million children - are grappling with mental health issues, suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The ravages of war have shattered support networks, leaving a staggering impact.\u00a0According to a survey conducted by the IRC, an astonishing 74% of clients reported being forcibly separated from a loved one. Moreover, 82% said that they experienced feelings of anxiety, stress, or sadness over the past few months. These distressing figures highlight the profound emotional toll war inflicts on individuals and the urgent need for compassionate intervention.The war\u2019s economic impact is also driving needs. The lack of financial resources to buy firewood, solid fuel, and warm clothes increases vulnerability. Many individuals are finding it increasingly difficult to provide enough food for their families. One out of every five Ukrainian households experienced food insecurity in 2023.The protracted nature of the conflict in Ukraine has made its impacts especially overwhelming, as many Ukrainians report feeling drained by ten years of conflict, with a sense that there is no end in sight.Meet Ukrainians affected by the war.Dr. Oleg (left) leads the IRC\u2019s mobile medical team in Kharkiv.

A 2023 report identified at least 43 facilities tasked with the \u201cpolitical re-education\u201d of Ukrainian children.In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children\u2019s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, alleging that they were responsible for the war crime of \u201cunlawful deportation of children.\u201dUkrainian refugees face barriers to servicesDespite finding safety in Europe, 6 million Ukrainian refugees still encounter obstacles in accessing crucial services and supporting their families. Only 40-60% of Ukrainian refugees are employed, often stuck in low-skilled positions that fail to match their qualifications. Meanwhile, a growing number find themselves in a vulnerable state, lacking the means to sustain themselves.They also face significant barriers to education; during the 2022-2023 academic year, almost half of Ukrainian school-aged refugees remained outside of the education system of their host countries. A multitude of factors contribute to the low enrollment rates, including administrative, linguistic, and legal obstacles. Additionally, limited awareness of available options and parental reluctance to enroll their children in host country schools, due to their intention of returning to Ukraine, further exacerbate the issue.Education is a fundamental right under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Sofiia and her mother, Olga, are refugees from Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region. They have found safety in Katowice, Poland where they regularly attend an IRC community livelihood community center where Olga receives employment support and Sofiia participates in learning activities.Photo: Tamara Kiptenko for the IRCAttacks on civilian infrastructureThroughout the 10-year conflict in Ukraine, schools have become a target of artillery strikes and have been occupied as military encampments, disrupting education for millions of children. More than 4,000 attacks on education facilities and over 1,300 attacks on health care facilities have been recorded since February 2022. International humanitarian law (IHL) forbids intentional attacks on civilians.\u00a0Deliberately targeting civilians or critical civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, could be deemed a war crime.Over 1.5 million homes have been destroyed and more than 27,000 civilian casualties have been recorded, including more than 10,000 deaths. The number of civilian casualties is believed to be considerably greater than reported due to the inability to include areas that are inaccessible due to ongoing hostilities.Despite repeated calls from the international community to respect IHL and to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, everyday Ukrainians continue to suffer from this war.Andriy stands in the ruins of a school in Vasylenkove, Ukraine. The village\u2019s hospital was also destroyed by the war.Photo: Oleksandr Rupeta for the IRCHow is the war affecting Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure and economy?The war has significantly damaged Ukraine\u2019s housing, transport, energy, and commerce and industry sectors.\u00a0According to the World Bank, Ukraine witnessed a 10% decline in GDP in 2014, coinciding with the onset of the conflict. Subsequently, with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, the GDP contracted by almost one-third.Amid positive signs of economic improvement, critical sectors like agriculture continue to reel from the effects of the ongoing conflict. An area the size of Romania is now riddled with landmines and the Nova Kakhkova dam explosion has left 600,000 hectares of arable land without irrigation.\u00a0Reconstruction and recovery costs are expected to exceed $410 billion.Ukrainians are struggling to make ends meetWith an unemployment rate of 17% and a substantial rise in poverty rates, a growing number of individuals find themselves in a perpetual battle to meet essential needs such as food, clothing, and medicine.An IRC survey of Ukrainian clients found that 70% of respondents reported losing a job or needing to change their career path as a result of the conflict, including 45% who had to accept another job with a lower wage or below their qualifications.What is the Black Sea Grain Initiative?Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative\u00a0-\u00a0a mechanism that allowed for the continued export of Ukrainian grain - is impacting both Ukraine\u2019s agriculture sector and international food securitySeveral grain-receiving countries across the Middle East and Africa have been experiencing hunger crises due to the compounded effects of conflict and climate change. The war in Ukraine made these hunger crises worse, putting more than 40 million lives in East Africa at risk.

The IRC has also provided direct cash assistance to more than 130,000 people in Ukraine.Our emergency programmes are also active on the ground across Europe and in the US. We respond to people\u2019s immediate and long-term needs, with activities targeting refugees from Ukraine in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, and Bulgaria, as well as in Germany, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\u00a0Learn more about the IRC\u2019s response to the crisis in Ukraine.Denis and her mother, Kateryna, stand in front of empty gas cylinders that the IRC distributed to residents of Kherson, along with cash assistance.

After hosting a meeting of 25 European leaders in Paris on February 26, Macron said that there was \u201cno consensus\u201d on committing ground troops to the conflict in Ukraine but added: \u201cNothing should be excluded. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war.\u201d Until now, Nato has confined itself to training Ukrainian military forces and supplying them with defensive weapons. Member states fear that directly confronting Russian forces in Ukraine would risk a massive escalation. And Vladimir Putin and his senior ministers have regularly issued threats that Russia could resort to using its nuclear arsenal in the case of a larger conflict.At present, Nato is also conducting its largest military exercise since the cold war. Steadfast Defender runs from January until May and involves all 31 member states. Aimed at enhancing the alliance\u2019s collective defence capabilities and readiness, it is the largest exercise since Reforger in 1988, which involved 125,000 troops from the US, Germany, Canada, France and Denmark.General Christopher Cavoli, Nato\u2019s supreme allied commander for Europe, said: \u201cSteadfast Defender 2024 will be a clear demonstration of our unity, strength and determination to protect each other, our values and the rules-based international order.\u201dImportantly, one aspect of the exercises is the involvement of US and Canadian forces, which is designed to demonstrate the speed and size of Nato\u2019s reinforcement capabilities. It acts both as a reassurance to European Nato member states and as a demonstration to potential enemies of the ability Nato has to put large forces into the field. Exercises are part of the communication of deterrence.The exercise is meant to simulate an, \u201cemerging conflict scenario with a near-peer adversary\u201d. This is a thinly disguised reference to Russia, which shows that Nato is beginning to take the threat of direct conflict with that country seriously.French marines conduct a training exercise in  Harstad, Norway as part of Steadfast Defender 2024.Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Danielle Serocki/APFootage/Alamy Stock PhotoDuring the cold war, Nato undertook regular large-scale exercises. For example, Exercise Lionheart, led by the UK in 1984, involved nearly 58,000 British soldiers and airmen of a total force of 131,565, including troops from the US, the Netherlands and what was then West Germany.Since the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, Nato has searched for a new identity. Its focus shifted in the 1990s from protecting common territory to protecting members\u2019 common interests, as it did by intervening in the wars in Bosnia in 1995 and Kosovo in 1999, when it officially approved this new strategic concept.Need for unityA demonstration of Nato unity and military capacity is important, coming after two years of disunity over how to respond to the war in Ukraine and amid wrangling over supplies of arms by Ukraine\u2019s western allies. It has become more significant following recent remarks by former president Donald Trump that Nato members who did not meet the spending guidelines would no longer be protected by the US.\u2018I would not protect you\u2019: Donald Trump threatens Nato members over defence spending.Members are supposed to spend at least 2% of their annual GDP on defence \u2013 but it\u2019s more complicated than that. Some nations\u2019 defence spending is wholly allocated to Nato. Others, meanwhile, might set their defence spending at less than 2%, but their spending per head is greater than that of those who meet the Nato guideline. For example, Luxembourg falls short of the 2%, spending only 0.72%. But in per head terms it spends US$921 (\u00a3726), which is more than Poland (3.9%) or France (1.9%). The US may spend 3.5% GDP on defence, but not all of that is allocated to Nato. Much of the US\u2019s strength is deployed in the Pacific and on its home territories. So it\u2019s misleading to judge the value of Nato membership in these terms. They key clause in the Nato treaty is article 5, which governs collective security and compels members to respond if a fellow member is attacked by a hostile third party. The US is the only Nato member state to have invoked article 5, following the 9/11 attacks. It received assistance from other Nato members in Afghanistan and more widely in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d.Is Nato battle ready?A significant problem Nato faces however, is not in deploying the troops it has, but in supplying them. As has been demonstrated by the efforts to provide equipment and ammunition to Ukraine, Nato has neither the stockpiles nor the manufacturing capacity to supply a lengthy modern war. This is because Nato has long planned on what\u2019s known as a \u201ccome as you are\u201d war, which means it has the capacity to fight for only as long as the equipment and supplies last. For this reason, Nato\u2019s strategy has always been, in the event of a conflict, to bring it to a conclusion as quickly as possible. Admiral Rob Bauer of the Royal Netherlands Navy, Nato\u2019s most senior military commander and military adviser to its North Atlantic Council, spoke at the Warsaw Security Forum in October 2023. He said: \u201cWe need large volumes. The just-in-time, just-enough economy we built together in 30 years in our liberal economies is fine for a lot of things \u2013 but not the armed forces when there is a war ongoing.\u201dA number of European countries have already distanced themselves from Macron\u2019s remarks, including Poland, the Czech republic and Sweden, whose Nato membership has finally been approved by Hungary and which is set to become the alliance\u2019s 32nd member.But Russia has seized on Macron\u2019s remarks, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov telling reporters that even discussing the idea of western troops being sent to fight in Ukraine represents a \u201cvery important new element\u201d. He added: \u201cIn that case, we would need to talk not about the probability, but about the inevitability (of a direct conflict).\u201dNATOUS foreign policyVladimir PutinEmmanuel MacronUkraine invasion 2022Give me perspectiveWant to write?

Since that time, the conflict has drifted towards the more negative end of expectations. Over the past year, Ukraine was unable to reverse many of Russia\u2019s territorial gains, and by the winter Moscow had regained the strategic initiative.At the end of 2022, Russia was in a worse predicament than Ukraine is now, but after hitting this low it found ways to fix its main problems. It began to innovate in terms of its military tactics in order to use its forces more effectively, used innovative recruitment tactics to fill its ranks, and transitioned towards a war economy to increase production of much-needed equipment.In contrast, the West failed to enact the policies necessary to ease Ukraine\u2019s materiel shortages. Over 2023, there was no concerted defence-industrial effort to resupply Ukraine with armoured fighting vehicles of various kinds. Even the production of ammunition is a long way behind schedule, particularly in Europe: of the 2.3 million shells used by Ukraine in 2023, only 300,000 were European. Joint European procurement initiatives on ammunition only became a reality in late 2023, and similar initiatives for military equipment will get going by 2024 at the earliest.The time this takes to materialise exacerbates Ukraine\u2019s dependency on American support, with the US presidential election in November likely to determine the country\u2019s fate. While current budgetary battles in the United States and partisan fights over military assistance have kicked in earlier than expected, Europeans nevertheless failed to use the last 12 months to prepare for this turn of events. The European Union\u2019s much-vaunted strategic autonomy goal is a mirage.As I predicted a year ago, there is no ceasefire, no negotiation, and no stalemate. Time and again, Vladimir Putin has made clear his aim is not to conquer just 20 per cent of Ukraine. In his mind, Russia and Ukraine are one, and the existence of an independent Ukrainian nation is an anti-Russian plot cooked up through foreign interference. His speech to the Russian defence ministry last month reconfirmed this ambition. He wants to annex the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine and would likely be content to turn the remainder into an occupied puppet state, little different to today\u2019s Belarus.Furthermore, Putin\u2019s political aim is to re-establish Russia as a new great power, reshaping the political order of Europe. Re-establishing the \u201cunity\u201d of Russia-Ukraine-Belarus is the precondition for this resurrection. A true ceasefire, or the abandonment of further attempts to conquer Ukraine, would for Putin mean not only the abandonment of his aspirations in that country, but his entire political vision for the future international order. He has invested immense resources in this gamble and will not easily reconsider, if not forced to do so. For these reasons, only binary outcomes are possible: either Russia wins or Ukraine wins.2024 will be the most challenging time for Ukraine since the first two months of the full-scale invasionGiven Western hesitation to ramp up arms production, and the lack of planning for the period after the counter-offensive, 2024 will be the most challenging time for Ukraine since the first two months of the full-scale invasion. By mid-2023, Kyiv had more or less given up relying on the West to resupply it with what it needed to sustain the war: drones, electronic warfare systems, and armoured combat vehicles such as tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The Ukrainian government looked at producing these locally and initiated an ambitious programme not only to resurrect Ukraine\u2019s pre-war arms industry, but even to surpass it with the assistance of Western companies. This has met with some success, but these vehicles will not be ready until next year, and will be available in larger quantities only by 2026. On top of this, Ukraine will remain dependent on the West for aircraft, aircraft armaments, and complex air-defence missiles because the complexity of these systems does not allow domestic production. Ukraine will also remain dependent on the supply of artillery munitions from abroad because of the sheer quantity used in the war.To this backdrop, three main scenarios present themselves.The positive scenarioIn the most positive scenario for Ukraine, Donald Trump finds himself barred from running for the presidency and Nikki Haley becomes the Republican nominee. She quickly moves to criticise the administration\u2019s weakness and indecision, which Joe Biden responds to by sending greater aid to Ukraine. The domestic mood turns around, and the US begins to provide Ukraine with more generous assistance, particularly more modern F-16C/D fighters, which have proper stand-off munitions and ATACMS missiles. With these, Ukraine is able to push Russian air forces further back from the front, decreasing their effectiveness.While Ukraine blunts Russian offensives and inflicts significant losses in manpower and equipment, it simultaneously manages to improve its training activities behind the front. It increases the cohesion of its units, forms \u201cnew force\u201d brigades, and tests new prototypes of electronic warfare equipment and drone defence weapons.The EU officially lists the defence industry as a sustainable industry, which eases access to research and development funds, credits, and insurance. This enables enhanced production of ammunition, vehicle spare parts, and the electronics that feed into Ukrainian drone manufacturing. And although the EU\u2019s move is much too late to make a difference this year, its effect will be felt in the years after. As such, by the end of 2024, Ukraine has put in place the preconditions needed to regain the initiative and liberate more territories in 2025, when more armoured combat vehicles roll off domestic and Western assembly lines and ammunition production has caught up with demand. In this regard, who wins the US presidential election has little bearing on events on the ground.The intermediate scenarioIn the intermediate scenario, the Biden administration muddles though 2024 in a messy election campaign. Republicans in Congress behave transactionally, trading Ukraine assistance packages for concessions on domestic pet projects such as the wall along the United States\u2019 southern border. The US carries on drip-feeding assistance to Ukraine.Meanwhile, Europeans continue to deliver only around a third of their ammunition and spare parts pledges, which helps the US keep Ukraine afloat \u2013 but only in a defensive posture. Ukraine manages to hold its lines on the battlefield. In Donbas, it will have to cede some terrain under Russian pressure. But it will maintain the integrity of its defensive lines and the formations fighting there. Ukraine\u2019s lack of armoured vehicles becomes particularly noticeable in the second half of 2024, once Europeans have expended their delivery of cold war legacy vehicles they had held in storage. Western-designed vehicles continue to suffer from shortages of spare parts, while Warsaw Pact legacy vehicles suffer from ammunition shortages.To cope with the insufficient materiel and the lack of trained officers, Ukraine disbands some newly formed brigades to achieve better manning levels of the remaining formations. It also continues to develop and experiment with new domestically produced equipment and refine its defensive tactics and unit cohesion during the year. However, because it needs to sacrifice soldiers to conserve precious and irreplaceable equipment, manning will become an increasing challenge by the end of 2024. Old and used European F-16A/B aircraft continue the role played by the Soviet fighters in the Ukrainian air force: they keep Russian planes away from civilian centres but struggle to contain them close to the front. In a nutshell, Ukraine remains on the defensive and survives 2024, with the result of the US presidential election set to decide the course of the war in 2025.The negative scenarioIn the most negative scenario for Ukraine, Trump becomes the presidential nominee, and increasingly anti-Ukrainian rhetoric dominates US discourse. In Congress, Republicans want to see Biden fail under any circumstances and refuse to accept horse-trades to keep the supply lines to Ukraine open. Europeans still send arms, but they lack the production capabilities and reserve stock needed to make up for the US. They fail to agree on long-term funding in the European Peace Facility, or to conclude large, long-term contracts for vehicles or ammunition, meaning the production capability of the European defence industry barely changes. At the same time, European defence-industrial cooperation with Ukraine faces difficulties.Ukrainian forces thus find themselves increasingly short of the shells and missiles they need just to maintain even defensive action. The Russian armed forces exploit this situation to increase the pressure on Ukrainian lines. Russian breakthroughs can only be contained by Ukrainian forces retreating. This pressure prevents Ukraine from properly rotating its forces in the front, leaving it unable to pull brigades from line duty to train and reconstitute them. By the end of 2024, most Ukrainian brigades are tired and exhausted.", "source": "https://ecfr.eu/article/ukraines-survival-three-scenarios-for-the-war-in-2024/", "description": "Russia has gained the upper hand in its war on Ukraine.

Russia exploits this by quickening the pace of strategic bombing against Ukrainian cities. Shahed drones probe local air defences, with conventional fighters following up by joining cruise missile attacks. These bombing campaigns impede Ukraine\u2019s plans to resurrect its defence industry and replace Western combat systems with domestically produced systems. The increasingly grim outlook convinces many Ukrainians to flee. By the end of 2024, 10 million Ukrainians have fled to the EU, with numbers rising. The cost to Europeans of hosting refugees far outweighs the cost of assisting Kyiv militarily.At the end of the year, Trump defeats Biden. Panic grips Europe, and many European capitals halt deliveries to Ukraine altogether, funnelling military supplies into their own armed forces in expectation of a US withdrawal from Europe and imminent Russian attacks on their own countries. The war in Ukraine is seen as lost by most in the West, although Ukraine itself keeps fighting against the odds.Course correctionBy the end of 2022, the Russian army had gone through its phase of weakness. Short of manpower, it had been driven off significant portions of terrain by a more agile, better motivated Ukrainian army. At that time the mood was optimistic, and a Russian defeat seemed probable. But these trends have now reversed.The West still has agency in this war; it can still turn things around. For Europeans in particular, this means putting their money where their mouth is. The acquisition of ammunition, missiles, combat vehicles, and spare parts is severely behind schedule \u2013 not that it was ambitious to begin with. Although late in the day, Europeans can still correct this course.", "source": "https://ecfr.eu/article/ukraines-survival-three-scenarios-for-the-war-in-2024/", "description": "Russia has gained the upper hand in its war on Ukraine.

Do a broad majority of Russians genuinely support the crimes and atrocities committed by their country\u2019s armed forces? And if not, why do they give every appearance of doing so?Two books by British historian Jade McGlynn published during 2023 provide uncomfortable answers. Russia\u2019s War gives one of those answers in its title: In direct and conscious contrast to a rash of other current book titles that lay the blame squarely on Russian President Vladimir Putin, McGlynn concludes that the Russian state, with the conscious collusion of part or most of its population, has achieved significant and widespread support at home for its war of colonial reconquest in Ukraine. Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin\u2019s Russia, Jade McGlynn, Bloomsbury Academic, 248 pp., , June 2023; Russia\u2019s War, Jade McGlynn, Polity, 264 pp., , May 2023Russia\u2019s War, Jade McGlynn, Polity, 264 pp., $54, May 2023; Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin\u2019s Russia, Jade McGlynn, Bloomsbury Academic, 248 pp., $27, June 2023The other book, Memory Makers, gives us more explanation of how this was made possible through Russia\u2019s deliberate and long-term program of hijacking history and shaping the public\u2019s memory by recreating the past in order to shape the present.Together, they paint a portrait of the alternative reality inhabited by Russians, created and nurtured by the state, and explain how it provides a permissive environment for that state\u2019s worst crimes against both its own people and its victims abroad.Russia\u2019s War will upset a lot of people. There\u2019s a substantial group among Russians abroad\u2014or at least, among those who do not wholeheartedly approve of the war\u2014who make their point that not all Russians are to blame for it by attempting to attach that blame to Putin personally.But McGlynn firmly rejects the idea that this is Putin\u2019s war alone. \u201cRussia\u2019s war on Ukraine is popular with large numbers of Russians and acceptable to an even larger number,\u201d she writes. \u201cPutin banked on the population\u2019s approval and he cashed it.\u201dMcGlynn\u2019s book is also a direct challenge to those Western journalists, academics, and Russophiles who cling to the belief that the country is a frustrated democracy, as well as the idea that left to their own devices, Russians would install a liberal government that was less inclined to repress its own subjects and wage wars of aggression abroad. That\u2019s a belief that has often been formed in conversation with urban, liberal Russians\u2014the kind who are now largely in exile or jail.But there\u2019s no reason to think that conversations in Moscow and St. Petersburg are any better a guide to Russia\u2019s population as a whole than similar conversations in New York or London were at predicting former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory or the United Kingdom\u2019s Brexit. When the idea of a country has been constructed on sampling that is as unrepresentative as this, it can be hard to come to terms with the fact that the behaviors that the world has witnessed in Ukraine are entirely within the mainstream of social norms in the further reaches of Russia.McGlynn doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that there may be Russians who disapprove of the war. But in addition to describing an instinct for self-preservation that may constrain many individuals from speaking out, she also argues that silent acquiescence is also the easier path inside their own minds.\u201cPlenty of people believe the Kremlin propaganda because it is easier and preferable to admitting or accepting that you are the bad guys,\u201d McGlynn writes. In the absence of any discernible public opposition, Russians\u2019 attitudes range from complete apathy to the frenzied enthusiasm for the war encouraged by propagandist \u201cZ-channels\u201d on Telegram, urging the military on to commit ever greater savagery in Ukraine. These channels, broadcasting to hundreds of thousands of subscribers\u2014where footage of atrocities receives a joyous reaction\u2014would not be possible in a country where backing for the onslaught on Ukraine was not widespread.Russia\u2019s state-aligned propaganda, McGlynn argues, does not seek to make everyone a warmonger. Instead, it aims to nudge people along a spectrum: It tries to render those in opposition apathetic, to make the apathetic feel attacked and side with their country whether right or wrong, and to induce quiet patriots to lend full-throated support.A further twist, McGlynn suggests, is that we should not assume that the ideal outcome for the Kremlin is widespread pro-war activism. The Kremlin distrusts any spontaneous political act even if it is in support of the regime, she reminds us. So it sets clear boundaries for what is and is not an acceptable way to show allegiance, and is content if the support shown is no more than lip service. But still, criticism of the war, where it does exist, primarily focuses on the competence with which it is being fought as opposed to whether it should be fought in the first place.Many of the state narratives around the West and Ukraine are not Putinist inventions, but instead are excuses for Russian state crimes that date back to Soviet and tsarist times. By tapping into the familiar tropes of Russia\u2019s artificial history, the Kremlin provides the basis for new and still-evolving fictions about the world outside, brought together in what McGlynn calls \u201ca time-worn ritual whereby Russian media and politicians slowly dismantle the truth and then replace it with a forgery.\u201dThat ritual is examined in detail in Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin\u2019s Russia. Appearing later than Russia\u2019s War, Memory Makers nonetheless lays the groundwork for it, exploring how Russia rewrote its history to provide justification for its present.History is explicitly defined as a battleground in Russia\u2019s national security strategy and other doctrinal documents. But as ever in Russia\u2019s perverse newspeak, goals such as the \u201cdefence of historical truth,\u201d the \u201cpreservation of memory,\u201d and \u201ccounteraction to the falsification of history\u201d translate\u00a0to the construction and defense of a fabricated version of Russian and Soviet history, accompanied by the denunciation of news and information from abroad as fake, all intended to protect and bolster Russia\u2019s alternative reality.As McGlynn explains, Russia\u2019s reworking of history builds a narrative that \u201cdistracts from government failings, promotes government policies and reinforces the Kremlin\u2019s view of current events.\u201d The two books together offer an understanding of how Russia fostered the mentality that enables the war. Memory Makers explains how it was done; Russia\u2019s War describes the effect.Across the two books, McGlynn considers the role of state propaganda in forming the attitude that she describes and the cumulative impact of more than a decade of bombardment with relentless war propaganda that dehumanizes Ukrainians and sells the idea of a hostile West. Her conclusion is that the war propaganda fell on fertile ground. Russians were eager to be guided toward the state-approved attitude that tied in closely with many of their preconceptions about the world and Russia\u2019s place in it.And this has had practical and tragic results. McGlynn helps explain why Russia\u2019s horrific casualty toll\u2014with estimates varying widely but none smaller than the hundreds of thousands\u2014has had less impact on popular support for the war than was widely and optimistically expected; and why Russia\u2019s soldiers are still fighting, despite their leadership\u2019s palpable indifference to the scale of the slaughter. Meanwhile, the dehumanization of Ukrainians that forms an integral part of the propaganda made atrocities in Ukraine not just likely, but also inevitable.", "source": "https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/21/ukraine-putin-war-russia-public-opinion-history/", "description": "no description provided", "title": "Ukraine Isn't Putin's War\u2014It's Russia's War"}, {"page_content": "In contrast with multiple books on Russia that have been produced swiftly after February 2022, both Russia\u2019s War and Memory Makers have long been in gestation. They draw on close to a decade of research, including data analysis of television, print and social media, extensive interviews, and\u2014while it was still possible\u2014firsthand investigation within Russia itself.Perhaps inevitably, that means neither book offers simple answers. Optimists among academics, journalists, and even government officials cling to the belief that if only Russians could be reached with the truth about the outside world, including the horrors committed in their name in Ukraine, they would turn against their leadership. But McGlynn\u2019s books and a mass of associated research show that far deeper and more radical societal change within Russia would be essential to reverse the effects of two decades of state propaganda.Since the end of the Soviet Union, early hopes that new generations might embrace democracy and liberalism have faded to invisibility. Instead, Russian social development is accelerating in reverse. McGlynn\u2019s research undercuts suggestions that this is being done to Russians against their will, and instead highlights attitudes ranging from complicity to enthusiasm. The result is that Russia looks almost exclusively to the past to define its vision for the future.The tragic implication is that Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine cannot be ended in or by Ukraine. Its roots lie in Russians\u2019 political and societal imagination of what their own country is and what it must be. That imagination, McGlynn shows, has been encouraged and facilitated\u2014but not created\u2014by a propaganda campaign that has lasted a generation.Jade McGlynn has assembled the evidence for a conclusion that will disturb optimists hoping for a better Russia: The campaign would not have succeeded without a willing and complicit population, and too many ordinary Russians are entirely content to back their country\u2019s most horrific actions.Books are independently selected by FP editors.

Russian warplanes were dropping more thousand-pound bombs on Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, reducing an already battered city to rubble and ashes.Since Jan. 1, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s forces have dropped around one million pounds of aerial bombs on an area encompassing just 12 square miles, according to estimates by Ukrainian officials and British intelligence.Avdiivka fell to the Russians on Saturday, after some of the most horrific and destructive fighting of the two-year-old war. In the end, Russia\u2019s superior firepower and manpower overwhelmed Ukrainian forces over many months, even as Russia incurred a staggering number of casualties.The Ukrainians withdrew under withering bombardment, fighting intense battles across ruined streets to break out of Russian attempts to encircle them. Russian warplanes bombed the hulking coke-processing plant on Avdiivka\u2019s northern outskirts, using incendiary munitions to blow up fuel tanks at the plant, unleashing a toxic smog, according to Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the plant.\u201cAvdiivka is a constant barrage of aviation bombs,\u201d Maksym Zhorin, deputy commander of the Third Special Assault Brigade, said on Friday. \u201cIt feels like the largest number of air bombs on such a stretch of land in the entire history of humanity. These bombs completely obliterate any positions. All buildings, structures, after just one airstrike, turn into craters.\u201dImageDisplaced civilians from Avdiivka waiting for aid in the town where they were evacuated and now live. ImageIhor Fir, a former mechanic at the Avdiivka coke processing plant, taking food, water and medicine to refugees evacuated from the city because of Russia\u2019s intense bombardment. Astonishingly, more than 900 civilians had remained in the city, according to city administrators and the police \u2014 from a prewar population of 30,000 \u2014 living subterranean lives and surviving on food and supplies brought in by aid workers.In the aftermath of the Ukrainian withdrawal, their fate was unknown.\u201cI have not been able to reach anyone for the past two days,\u201d said Ihor Fir, a mechanic at the coke plant before it was destroyed, who was regularly risking his life to bring food, water and medicine to the civilians still living in Avdiivka and surrounding villages.The last messages he received were from people desperate to escape, but unable to move under the constant shelling. Any survivors in the city, he said, were likely to be stranded. \u201cThere is no way for them to get out,\u201d he said by phone on Saturday. \u201cThe road is under shelling.\u201dIn an interview last week, Mr. Fir called conditions in Avdiivka \u201cjust horrible\u201d and shared videos and photos of the devastation from his last trip into the city earlier this month. \u201cThere are ruins everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single house left untouched.\u201dUKRAINEAvdiivkaCity boundaryApproximatearea taken byRussia sinceFeb. 13AvdiivkaHeld by Russiaon Feb. 131 mileUKRAINEAvdiivkaCity boundaryApproximatearea taken byRussia sinceFeb. 13AvdiivkaHeld by Russiaon Feb. 131 mileUKRAINEAvdiivkaCity boundaryApproximatearea taken byRussia sinceFeb. 13AvdiivkaHeld by Russiaon Feb. 131 mile", "source": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/world/europe/ukraine-russia-avdiivka.html", "description": "Toward the end of Russia\u2019s long assault, hundreds of civilians still remained in Avdiivka.

His claim could not be independently confirmed, but the British intelligence agency reported that in just four weeks, Russian warplanes dropped some 600 guided bombs on Avdiivka, with as many as 50 recorded in a single day.The Russian tactics in Avdiivka were \u201ca textbook punishment campaign, which they have orchestrated in Chechnya, Syria, Ukraine and even Afghanistan,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cIt is designed,\u201d he said, \u201cto raise the societal costs of continued resistance and coerce the adversary and its population to give up.\u201d Mr. Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka as \u201can important victory,\u201d the Kremlin said on Saturday.There are no reliable statistics on the number of soldiers or civilians killed in the bombardments.Mr. Fir shared pictures of the ruins of a supermarket hit by a bomb last week as 15 people sheltered in the basement. At least 10 of them died and remained buried in the rubble, he said.\u201cA person goes to sleep and does not wake up,\u201d he said as he traveled to bring food and water to refugees in a village about three miles from Avdiivka. As the Russians advanced to the north and west, they flattened that village as well. At least half the homes where the refugees took shelter were bombed.ImageA morning airstrike from a Russian jet last June destroyed an apartment building in Avdiivka, wounding several civilians.ImageThe only remaining resident of one street in Avdiivka last June. The city already faced Russian shelling on three sides, and his apartment building was heavily damaged. Avdiivka has been on the front line of fighting for a decade, dating to Russia\u2019s first bid to cleave off a part of eastern Ukraine, in 2014. The constant skirmishes often receded into the background. Life for the 30,000 residents could be difficult, but manageable.The city was known then for the sparkling blue lakes that filled former quarries. Residents were proud and determined to stay and live an active life despite being on the front line. At the annual festival to celebrate the city\u2019s founding in 1956, the loud music would drown out distant shelling.\u201cAvd\u0456\u0456vka was a good, beautiful town,\u201d said Victoria, 52, who was one of the last civilians to escape Avdiivka this month and asked that her family name not be used because she feared for her life. \u201cWe lived. We worked. Everything was good for us.\u201dThat all ended on Feb. 24, 2022, when the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion.The Kremlin immediately set its sights on Avdiivka, shelling from a distance and skirmishing in industrial zones, but failed time and again to break through Ukrainian fortifications.After his home was destroyed last May, Mr. Fir fled with his wife. By June, there were fewer than 2,000 civilians in Avdiivka, most of them living largely underground.The hulking industrial plant with its warren of Soviet-era nuclear fallout shelters offered refuge for people as fighting intensified. But eventually civilians were evacuated and the plant became a fortress for the Ukrainian military. Civilians who remained in Avdiivka mostly sheltered in basements.Victoria refused to evacuate. \u201cMy husband was killed by a bomb on July 15, 2022,\u201d she said. He was getting water from a well when he was blown apart, she said. When her mother also died, she had only her dog and her mother\u2019s dog to keep her company.\u201cI did not want to leave because the graves of my relatives remained here,\u201d she said.ImageCivilians in another embattled Ukrainian city not too far from Avdiivka survive underground in the basements and corridors of apartment buildings to protect them from Russian shelling.ImageDisplaced civilians from Avdiivka receiving basic supplies. One woman said she had long delayed leaving \u201cbecause the graves of my relatives remained here.\u201d  Dozens of interviews over the last two years show that the reasons civilians stay behind in war zones are complicated.\u201cI just put up with it,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cI thought sooner or later, it had to end somehow. It didn\u2019t stop \u2014 it just got worse and worse.\u201dIn early October, Russia launched the first of a series of large-scale offensives aimed at broadly encircling Avdiivka.Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers were killed and wounded in repeated waves of assaults, according to Ukrainian and Western officials. Ukraine, despite suffering its own losses, held on.The Russians devised a new plan this winter, using a two-mile-long drainage tunnel to burrow under Ukrainian fortifications, infiltrate a neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city and ambush the Ukrainians.As the Russians advanced, some civilians escaped on foot to the city center, where they were met by a special police unit, known as the White Angels, to be evacuated.The Ukrainian police shared a video of an evacuation last month, with civilians describing chaos and bloodshed as Russians entered their neighborhood.\u201cWhen the Russian troops entered, it wasn\u2019t just a nightmare, it was some kind of Armageddon,\u201d an old man said. \u201cBlood, deaths, looting. Thirty-four years in the mines, and everything I did for my family, it\u2019s all destroyed.\u201dTheir accounts could not be independently verified.But dozens of horror stories were relayed by residents who managed to get out as Russian forces fought their way deeper into the city.ImageTetiana recovering at a hospital after she was injured when a bomb exploded in AvdiivkaImageViktor Hrydin, 87, who helped build the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant, long the city\u2019s economic engine, refused to leave his dwelling until a bomb on Christmas destroyed it and badly wounded the woman caring for him.Viktor Hrydin, 87, who helped build the coke plant that has long been Avdiivka\u2019s economic engine, refused to go even as his world burned around him. A neighbor, Tetiana, 52, moved in to take care of him.On Christmas, a bomb exploded at their home.\u201cI was covered in blood,\u201d Viktor said in an interview at a hospital where he was recovering. \u201cAnd her blood was flowing like a river.\u201dTetiana\u2019s leg was ripped apart, and a bullet had torn through his arm. Still, he was able to pull her to safety. She was recovering in a room with seven other heavily injured women. They were alive, but their lives were shattered.\u201cIn old age, I was left with nothing,\u201d Viktor said.Even after two years of unfathomable violence, Victoria was not prepared for Russia\u2019s final bid to annihilate her city.Residents on Chernyshevskoho Street, near the entrance of the city, she said, \u201cwere bombed so badly that people just wrapped themselves in white sheets\u201d and wandered out into the open, hoping to find a volunteer to take them out.\u201cPeople were dying there every day,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do to escape, no basement, nothing.\u201d\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t leave,\u201d she said, \u201cI would just go crazy.\u201dShe was one of the last people to make it out of Avdiivka, on Feb. 2, before evacuation became impossible.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAt least 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed fighting back against the Russian invasion that began two years ago, Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, providing the first official death toll from Kyiv in more than a year.\"31,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed in this war. Not 300,000, not 150,000... (Russian president Vladimir) Putin is lying there... But nevertheless, this is a big loss for us,\" he said in a news conference at the Ukraine Year Forum in Kyiv.Mr Zelensky said Russia\u2019s casualties \u2013 both injured and dead \u2013 during the invasion stood at 500,000, of which 180,000 were Russian soldiers killed in the war, according to Kyiv\u2019s estimates.\"I won\u2019t say how many wounded (Ukrainians) there are because Russia will know how many people have left the battlefield,\" he said.Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has rejected the tolls provided by Ukraine. Russia has not shared its own tally of Russian soldiers killed and wounded in the two-year-long invasion of Ukraine, and treats the information as a classified state secret.Mr Zelensky added that \u201ctens of thousands of civilians\u201d had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but said that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many of our civilians they killed. We don\u2019t,\u201d he said.In the last update at the end of 2022, Mr Zelensky\u2019s aide Mykhailo Podolyak had said 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the invasion on 24 February in that year.According to a joint report by Russia media outlets Meduza and Mediazona, at least 83,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the continuing invasion.The war, now in its third year, has seen Russia throw huge numbers of soldiers into grinding battles for strategic footholds along the frontline, such as Bakhmut in the earlier stages of the conflict or more recently the eastern city of Avdiivka.Mr Zelensky predicted the war is set to enter a fresh phase as he warned of a new offensive from Russia likely starting in late May or the summer.\"We will prepare for their assault. Their assault that began on 8 October has not brought any results, I believe. We, for our part, will prepare our plan and follow it,\" Mr Zelensky said, speaking to reporters in Kyiv.He added that Kyiv has a clear plan to counter Russian forces but did not share details over fears of compromising the military counteroffensive.\"There is a plan, the plan is clear, I can\u2019t tell you the details,\" he said.Ukraine\u2019s war effort, he said, depended on Western support, which has slowed significantly in recent months. He said the European Union had only supplied 30 per cent of the 1 million ammunition shells that were promised so far.Mr Zelensky said he was nonetheless confident that the US Congress would approve a major new batch of military and financial assistance and that Ukraine needed that decision within a month.More aboutRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraineKyivJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Zelensky says 31,000 Ukraine soldiers killed but Russia loses 180,000Zelensky says 31,000 Ukraine soldiers killed but Russia loses 180,000Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky answers media questions during his press conference in KyivAP\u2715Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Reporting |                    QiOSKqiosk ukraine warJim LobeFeb 22, 2024Europeans have become increasingly pessimistic about the chances that Ukraine can recover territories that it has lost since the Russian invasion two years ago, according to a new poll of 12 EU member states.And an aggregate average of 41 percent of respondents in the 12 countries said they would prefer that Europe \u201cpush Ukraine towards negotiating a peace with Russia\u201d compared to 31 percent who said Europe \u201cshould support Ukraine in taking back the territories occupied by Russia.\u201dThe poll, which was released by the European Council on Foreign Relations Wednesday, was conducted during the first half of January, before the latest advances by Russian forces in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, notably in their takeover of the town of Avdiivka, which is likely to add to the impression that Kyiv is increasingly on the defensive.The survey interviewed a total of more than 17,000 adults in the 12 countries, which included Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden.It found that continued support for Ukraine\u2019s war aims was strongest in Sweden, Portugal, and Poland where pluralities of respondents said Europe should support Kyiv\u2019s efforts to take back its territory. Support was weakest in Austria, Romania, Italy, Greece, and Hungary, where significant pluralities or large majorities in the five countries said Europe should focus on achieving a negotiated settlement. In France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany, opinion was more divided between the two alternatives.The poll\u2019s results offered a marked contrast to previous polling by ECFR, according to Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, co-authors of a report released with the survey. In June 2022, ECFR found that many Europeans favored a quick resolution to the war, even if that meant Ukraine would have to give up territory. But buoyed by Ukraine\u2019s battlefield successes in regaining territory one year later, a subsequent poll in 2023 found that a plurality of respondents in nine EU countries that were surveyed at the time wanted to support Ukraine\u2019s war aims and believed they were achievable.\u201cNow, in the aftermath of Ukraine\u2019s disappointing counteroffensive and amid flagging support in Western capitals, some of that optimism seems to have dissipated,\u201d according to the two co-authors.Indeed, an aggregate average of only ten percent of respondents in the new poll now believe that Ukraine will defeat Russia, while twice as many, or 20 percent, believe that Moscow will prevail. Across all countries, a plurality of respondents (37 percent on average) believes that a compromise settlement between the two countries will be the most likely outcome.The survey also queried respondents on the impact of a possible victory by former president Donald Trump in November\u2019s U.S. elections on the Ukraine war. An aggregate average of 43 percent of respondents said a new Trump presidency would make a Ukrainian victory \u201cless likely.\u201d Asked what Europe should do if Trump were to end U.S. aid to Ukraine, an aggregate average of 41 percent respondents said they would favor maintaining (21 percent) or increasing (20 percent) aid to Kyiv, while a third of respondents said they would prefer to follow the U.S. in limiting assistance.

(Stringer/Reuters)Listen5 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveAs top Russian and Ukrainian generals assess the battlefield after nearly two brutal years of stalemated \u201cpositional\u201d warfare, they draw the same lessons: Tanks, manned aircraft and traditional maneuver forces are sitting ducks, while advanced drones and digital battle-management systems can have a decisive impact.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightRussia has come to realize what Ukraine recognized more than a year ago: This is an \u201calgorithm war,\u201d one where digital intelligence and targeting systems have rewritten the rules of conflict. The \u201cfog of war\u201d experienced by commanders for centuries has cleared. In the newly transparent battlespace, movements by large units are instantly visible and vulnerable.This look into Russian and Ukrainian military assessments is possible thanks to commentaries published in the past two weeks by two veteran commanders, Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, a former chief of the Russian general staff, and Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, head of the Ukrainian military. They appeared, respectively, in Army Standard, a Russian publication, and on the website of the Ukrainian defense ministry.AdvertisementThe commentaries were flagged to me by Kevin Ryan, a retired Army brigadier general who served as U.S. defense attach\u00e9 in Moscow and then taught at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center. He translated the articles and circulated them this week among Russia specialists. Zaluzhny made similar comments about the importance of drones in an interview published in November in the Economist, but the Russian analysis is new and startling.Follow\u00a0this authorDavid Ignatius's opinionsFollow\u201cThese two adversaries see many of the same lessons,\u201d Ryan writes in an email summarizing the commentaries. The generals recognize that in the Ukraine battlespace, \u201cno concentration of troops, large or small, can escape the ever-present reconnaissance by unmanned aerial systems and satellites,\u201d he notes.The tactical revolution underway in Ukraine underlines why a congressional failure to approve continued U.S. military support for Kyiv would be so devastating. As Russia gains increasing mastery of digital warfare, Zaluzhny worries that Ukraine is hobbled by \u201cexhaustion of our partners\u2019 stocks of missiles and ammunition\u201d and \u201cthe difficulty of our allies in determining the priorities of support.\u201dAdvertisementBaluyevsky\u2019s comments read like a wake-up call to his fellow Russian officers. He argues that the so-called special military operation in Ukraine has been \u201can unprecedented test of literally all components of military affairs and military construction.\u201d His analysis came in the foreword for an anthology of essays about the war, which was then summarized in Army Standard by Russian journalist Sergey Valchenko.Baluyevsky echoes many Western commentators who have argued that defense has trumped offense in Ukraine. \u201cAir defense has won an unexpected triumph over military aviation,\u201d which has \u201clost the ability to operate en masse over enemy territory\u201d and even must fly \u201cwith caution over its own territory.\u201dThe tank \u201chas become one of the main casualties of the combat experience of the last two years,\u201d he explains, since it was \u201can easily detected and easily hit target\u201d and \u201cturned out to be very vulnerable to mines.\u201d Similarly, \u201cthe impossibility of concentrating troops \u2026 forces us to conduct combat operations with small units and separate combat vehicles.\u201dAdvertisementBaluyevsky has some scathing comments about the performance of Russian weapons. \u201cThe qualitative superiority of NATO artillery is evident,\u201d he contends. Ukraine \u201chas revealed a significant lag in Russian artillery and missile systems and requires their priority radical rearmament in the next few years.\u201dThe winners in this war are drones. \u201cUnmanned aircraft have rapidly and unconditionally conquered the airspace,\u201d Baluyevsky argues. Zaluzhny agrees that \u201cunmanned systems, along with other new types of weapons, are almost the only tool for getting out of\u201d the stalemate of trench warfare.Zaluzhny bemoans Russia\u2019s manpower advantage and Ukraine\u2019s \u201cinability \u2026 to improve the state of staffing of the Defense Forces without the use of unpopular measures,\u201d such as a nationwide draft. His disagreement with President Volodymyr Zelensky about the need for such an all-out mobilization is one reason for recent tension between the two men \u2014 and Zelensky\u2019s reported readiness to sack his commander.AdvertisementUkraine, as I wrote after visiting Kyiv in October, is exhausted by war and slowly bleeding out. Zaluzhny implicitly recognizes this war fatigue in arguing for increased use of unmanned systems to \u201creduce the level of losses \u2026 reduce the degree of participation of traditional means of destruction \u2026 [and] limited involvement of heavy equipment.\u201dThe lesson for the United States, beyond the simple but urgent need to continue military assistance for Ukraine, is to focus that support on the high-tech weapons that matter. The weapons that have generated endless debate, such as tanks and F-16 fighters, are less important than drones, antiaircraft systems and electronic-warfare jammers.The best weapons today, agree the Russian and Ukrainian generals, might be small, cheap systems such as \u201cfirst-person view,\u201d or FPV drones that fly into targets like tiny suicide bombers and can be almost impossible to stop. The chilling fact is that these silent killers can be bought and used by almost any combatant, anywhere on Earth. It is, as the generals agree, a new day in warfare.Share CommentsPopular opinions articlesHAND CURATEDOpinion|What the Supreme Court told usFebruary 29, 2024Opinion|What the Supreme Court told usFebruary 29, 2024Opinion|Supreme Court aids and abets Trump\u2019s bid for delayFebruary 29, 2024Opinion|Supreme Court aids and abets Trump\u2019s bid for delayFebruary 29, 2024Opinion|Women are divorcing \u2014 and finally finding happinessFebruary 28, 2024Opinion|Women are divorcing \u2014 and finally finding happinessFebruary 28, 2024View 3 more storiesSign upTOP STORIESAdviceMoral dilemmas, relationships, parenting and moreAsk Amy: My brother is upset I didn\u2019t answer his unscheduled callCarolyn Hax: Under pressure to forgive ailing mom for abandoning them as kidsMiss Manners: Don\u2019t ask friends for donations for your charityRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com  \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2024 The Washington Post", "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/02/06/russia-ukraine-drone-war-technology-stalemate/", "description": "Thanks to drones, the \u201cfog of war\u201d experienced by commanders for centuries has cleared.", "title": "Opinion | What a Russian and Ukrainian general agree on: This war is different - The Washington Post"}, {"page_content": "Ukraine war two years on \u2013 the view from Western Europe and the US | YouGov", "source": "https://yougov.co.uk/international/articles/48720-ukraine-war-two-years-on-the-view-from-western-europe-and-the-us", "description": "Attitudes remain largely the same as they were at the time of the first anniversary of the invasion", "title": "Ukraine war two years on \u2013 the view from Western Europe and the US | YouGov"}, {"page_content": "UK Australia  France  Germany  Italy  Spain  Singapore  Switzerland  United States  Vietnam Public Data Explore YouGov's freely accessible data Discover our public data, featuring a diverse range of survey results, articles, trackers and popularity rankings.From the latest political surveys to in-depth analysis, find out what the world thinks.

More than four in ten Americans (43%) say the same. In each of these four countries, those willing to stand by Ukraine significantly outnumber those who want to encourage a negotiated peace, at 21-27%.Italians tend to take the opposite view, preferring a negotiated peace even if it left Russia still in control of parts of Ukraine by 45% to 28%.The French, German and Spanish publics are all closely divided.Two years into the Ukraine war, how much do Western Europeans and Americans care who wins?There are likewise great differences between countries regarding how far people care who wins the war in Ukraine. Swedes care the most, with 82% saying it matters to them \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d who wins the war, including a majority (53%) who care a great deal.In Britain, 70% say they care who wins, as do 64% in the USA.At the other end of the scale, only 46% of Italians say the outcome of the war matters much to them.Relatively few in any nation surveyed actively want Russia to win \u2013 Germans (14%), French people and Italians (both 11%) are the most likely to say so.While most people in each country want Ukraine to win, the numbers differ significantly, ranging from 88% in Denmark and 85% in Sweden to 52% in Italy. In the UK that figure stands at 79% and in the US it is 72%.Two years on, is the West doing enough to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine?Across all eight countries surveyed, the belief is that the West is not providing enough support to Ukraine to help them ultimately repel their Russian adversaries. Swedes and Spaniards are the most likely to say so (both 64%) and Germans the least likely (44%). A majority of Britons (57%) likewise think the West is not doing enough, as do 46% of Americans.Americans and Germans are the most likely to think that Ukraine is getting enough assistance, at 25-26%.Two years into the war, what kind of support are Western Europeans and Americans willing to provide Ukraine?While most across the West want Ukraine to win, and acknowledge that there is not enough support being given in order to make that happen, that does not equate to willingness to provide additional support.Given the option to maintain, increase, or reduce aid to the beleaguered nation, the most common preference in each country surveyed is for the former, at 37-50% (except in Germany, where the 30% who want to maintain support levels are outweighed marginally by the 34% who want to reduce them).Swedes are the most likely to want to send more support, at 30%.In the USA, where recent attempts to get Congress to approve further funding for Ukraine have stalled, the public are relatively split \u2013 23% want to send more support, 33% want to maintain current levels, and 26% want to reduce support.When it comes to the kind of support people are willing to back, top of the list are 'maintain the current sanctions regime' (48-76%) and 'imposing further economic sanctions on Russian interests in each country' (44-70%).There is also relatively strong support for sending additional weaponry and supplies to Ukraine (46-70%), although Italy is a notable outlier, with only 29% willing to back this move. In fact, fewer than 50% of Italians support any of the measures we tested.Taking military action in Russia gathers the least in each country. Only between 13-33% support sending troops into Ukraine, and 19-38% back air strikes against Russian targets in the country.Support for each measure has remained relatively static over the last year; in none of the European countries surveyed (the US has not been asked this question previously) has support for any measure increased by more than six points or fallen by more than four.Nevertheless, compared to the first round of results, shortly after the invasion in 2022, enthusiasm for several of the measures is particularly diminished in Germany and Italy. These two countries are typically the least likely to want to give support to Ukraine.Two years into the Ukraine war, which side do Europeans and Americans think has the advantage?Compared to a year ago, Europeans are now more likely to think that Russia has the advantage in the conflict. In most countries there has been a 9-14 point increase in this belief, except in Italy where it has grown by a slower rate of four points.Nevertheless, the most common opinion in most country is that neither side has the advantage, at between 39-48%. Spain is an exception (as it was last year), with most Spaniards saying the Russians have the advantage (58%) and only 24% believing neither side has the upper hand.Americans likewise are more likely to say that Russia has the upper hand (36%) than seeing a stalemate (30%).Only 3-9% think Ukraine is in the stronger position.With the war two years old, Europeans and Americans tend to think the conflict has at least another year to goUnsurprisingly, given the results of the prior question, the most common belief (49-72%) is that the war has at least another war to run. This is up 4-12pts compared to last year in the European countries (the US was not surveyed last year).Expectations that Ukraine will triumph over the next twelve months stand at only 9-13%, down slightly from last year. Few also expect that Russia will finally conquer Ukraine in the coming year, at 5-13%, effectively unchanged since 2023.See the full results herePhoto: Getty Explore more data & articles UkraineUkraine - Russia WarWar & Conflict How should the West respond to a nuclear attack?

In recent years, it has played a key role in a number of political shifts and crises4,5. While social media has been found to amplify all manners of misinformation, propaganda, populism, and xenophobia6,7,8, it can also serve as a mechanism to call for aid and as a source for live updates of major events unfolding9,10,11,12.In this article, we analyse language use of Ukrainian citizens on social media before and during the Russian invasion of Ukraine (subsequently referred to as war), where after years of tensions and open aggression between Russia and Ukraine13, on 24th February 2022, Russian forces began to invade and occupy parts of Ukraine14. At the time of writing, it has been estimated that the war has led to over 23,000 civilian casualties15 and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage16,17. This has caused worldwide unrest, alongside 8.2 million Ukrainian refugees recorded across Europe and 5 million registered for temporary protection18,19.The war in Ukraine is also taking place in the digital era, with social media coverage documenting the horrific events in up to real-time. This provides a unique digital trace of many first-hand accounts of the war, as citizens are communicating among each other and to the public. This is generally known as crisis informatics, whereby social media data are utilized before, during, or after emergency events for use cases such as disaster monitoring, management, and prevention9,12,20,21,22. Recent studies have demonstrated that tweets can capture events of political violence23 and can help in monitoring and understanding intra-country conflicts24.In our work, the user\u2019s choice of language in a tweet is of particular interest. Many people across the world (including most Ukrainian citizens with the Russian and Ukrainian language25) are multilingual. This multilingualism comes with a number of links to an individual\u2019s identity, as someone may speak one language at work, but another one at home with their family. Thus, different languages are spanning across multiple facets of one\u2019s identity26. These context-based adaptations of our self-presentation and behaviour are expected by those around us27,28,29,30. Hence, it is important to note that a user\u2019s choice of language online can be argued as an active choice to communicate and a way they seek to present themselves to their audience26. For example, many non-natives switch to English in order to ensure a wider intelligibility online31.The use of language is also inherently political. Languages can be the cause of conflict and they are often incorporated in cultural and ethnic identity definition and are the basis for nation building and political change32,33. After the dissolution of the USSR, most post-soviet countries introduced new language laws in order to assert their original native language and build a new nation32,34. In Ukraine, after their independence, many people were considering themselves Russians by nationality or Ukrainian with Russian as their main native language35,36. While the government aimed to reverse those effects, they were only moderately successful in achieving this goal, as census results show35,36,37. Only more recently, with the Euromaidan protests and the Russian military intervention in Crimea and the Donbas, surveys between 2012 and 2017 show a consistent and substantial shift away from Russian ethnic and linguistic identification towards Ukrainian practice37.We investigate language choice and tweeting activity on Ukrainian Twitter (now called X) from January 2020 to November 2022 using over 4 million geo-tagged tweets from more than 62,000 different users. In doing this, we study how Ukrainian citizens (and non-citizens living there) respond to their country being aggressively attacked and invaded by its direct neighbour they share a long history and language with, and how the use of language evolved before and during this war. Our study allows us to follow the same set of users and observe their (change in) behaviour over both the short- and longer-term as the war breaks out and continues to unfold on an individual level. Hence, we are able to comment on recent news articles outlining shifts in language use from Russian to Ukrainian as a direct result of the war38,39. Moreover, we are able to monitor long-term language trends even before the war without the necessity of relying on small-scale surveys nor the infrequent censuses, the last one of which was conducted in 2001.More specifically, we study overall trends in the number of tweets in the three main languages (Ukrainian, Russian, English) over time. Second, we investigate how these trends translate to users\u2019 individual tweeting activity and if changes result from the in- and outflux of users, common in online communities40,41,42, or if they result from users changing their behaviour over time43,44,45. We quantify the magnitude of both effects respectively. Third, we study if changes in users\u2019 tweeting activity originate from shifts between languages and quantify the magnitude of these shifts. Fourth and finally, we take a closer look at those users that switch from predominately tweeting in Russian to predominately tweeting in Ukrainian with the outbreak of the war.MethodsThis study was ethically approved by the ethics commission of the faculty of mathematics, computer science and statistics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (LMU) M\u00fcnchen, Germany. The reference identifier is EK-MIS-2022-127. We did not preregister this study. No information on user demographics such as age, sex, gender or race were collected or determined and - in accordance with the ethics commission - no informed consent by the Twitter users was obtained.DataData collection & final datasetWe collected tweets from 9th January 2020 to 12th October 2022 using the 1% real-time stream of the Twitter API. During collection, we filtered the data such that we only gathered tweets containing geo-information from the API. We then manually filtered the dataset to only retain tweets from Ukraine (denoted by the \u201cUA\u201d country tag), as common in the literature46, and excluded any retweets, which left us with primary tweets, quotes and replies, all of which contain original tweet texts.This dataset obtained from the 1% stream consisted of 4,102,982 tweets. As we began cleaning, we noticed gaps with missing tweets, most likely due to server and internet outages during the real-time data collection process. Hence, we retrospectively identified and filled all gaps. To do this, we first identified all time windows\u2009>10 min without any tweet and added them to our download queue. Days with more than two of such time windows were added to the queue as a whole. We then queried the Twitter Research API 2.0 using the tweets/search/all endpoint to obtain tweets with Ukrainian geoinformation for all time windows in this queue and added the newly obtained tweets to our original dataset. Finally, we repeated this process for the 15 days with the least amount of tweets in our dataset. After removing all duplicates, this meant we added a total of 350,359 additional tweets to our dataset this way. Our subsequently conducted sensitivity analysis shows that through the two-stage filtering process combined with the recollection efforts, we were able to recover almost all geo-tagged tweets from Ukraine during this time period (see section \u201cSensitivity Analysis\u201d for more info).We conducted an extensive spam filtering scheme, in which we (1) removed any duplicate tweets, (2) identified and removed potential spam bots by training a bot detection model following47, (3) removed users with >100 tweets per day, (4) only kept tweets coming from official Twitter clients or Instagram, and (5) applied additional filtering rules specific to our dataset. This reduced our dataset from originally 4,453,341 tweets (62,712 users) down to 2,845,670 tweets (41,696 users). For a more extensive description and rationale see section \u201cData Cleaning\u201d.User characteristicsUnsurprisingly, social media is popular in Ukraine, particularly among the younger generation, with almost all citizens aged 18-39 in 2021 reporting that they use social media. For Twitter, user statistics are as follows: 18\u201329 (13% usage), 30\u201339 (8%), 40\u201349 (7%), 50+ (1%)48.We provide an overview and descriptive statistics on all user attributes as available from the API in Supplementary Table\u00a04. The relevant user attributes for our main results and their assigned names are described in the following. Followers are the number of accounts that follow a user. Followings reports the number of accounts a user is following. The account age the number of months a user account has existed from account creation to their latest tweet in our dataset. The tweet frequency the number of tweets per day. The like frequency the number of liked tweets (by the user) per day. # of Tweets in Ukraine reports the total number of tweets in our dataset. All Twitter user attributes are a snapshot from the last time we observe a user\u2019s respective tweet in our sample.As described in Supplementary Notes\u00a01, we conduct multilingual topic modelling using BERTopic49. War topic 1 reports the number of tweets assigned to first war topic cluster (topic #1), which covers updates about the war and calls for help. War topic 1 (rel.) the relative share of tweets assigned to this topic. War topic 2 reports the number of tweets assigned to second war topic cluster (topic #3), which covers a more political side of the overall conflict. War topic 2 (rel.) the relative share. A full list of all topic clusters is available in Supplementary Table\u00a01.Sensitivity analysisAfter data collection (before the cleaning), we evaluated the completeness of the dataset, i.e. whether we were able to recover most of the tweets published in Ukraine over the course of the study period, using the following strategy.

We find a coverage of 98.24% (SD: 3.09%). More importantly, in the opposite direction we are only able to report a coverage of 77.67% (SD: 9.55%). Hence, employing our strategy using the real-time stream offers substantially more tweets, which have been deleted since (for more information on tweet deletion and its effects see ref. 50). Moreover, this suggests we were able to recover most of the geo-tagged tweets from Ukraine.Data cleaningFor cleaning our dataset, we first train a Twitter bot detection model using a random forest (RF), as described in ref. 47. We use the exact same model as described in the authors\u2019 work (except for removing the attribute profile_use_background_image, which is no longer available from the Twitter API), using the training datasets botometer-feedback, celebrity, political-bots, as well as 100 manually labelled Twitter accounts from our dataset. To evaluate performance, we first set up a nested cross validation (CV) routine, with both a fivefold CV in the inner and outer loop. The inner CV is used for hyperparameter tuning, tuning both the number of trees as well as the minimum node size of the RF, whereas the outer loop is used for evaluating model performance. This results in an average area under the receicer operator characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.9837 and an average area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.7707. For our final model, we replicate this procedure, by setting up a 5-fold CV on the entire dataset to find the best performing hyperparameters. We then train our RF on the entire dataset and use this model to identify bots and spam accounts in our dataset.As we are only interested in removing the most prevalent spam, we opt for a conservative removal strategy to not falsely remove too many real and non-spam users. Hence, we only remove users with a predicted bot probability\u2009>50% and more than 10 tweets since account creation as well as users with a predicted bot probability\u2009>30% and more than 10,000 tweets. While thresholds of 50% and 30% respectively might not seem conservative, in the given setting, in which the bot class is heavily underrepresented (3.7% of observations in training dataset), an F1-optimizing threshold on the training dataset would lie far below that. We are somewhat less conservative with users that published over 10000 tweets, as in most cases they are spam accounts (e.g. related to bitcoins or NFTs). We do to not remove users with less than 11 tweets, as even for a human it becomes incredibly difficult to determine if a user is a bot with such limited amount of information to draw from. At the same time, we noticed a large influx of new users after the outbreak of the war who exclusively called for help in a short span of time, a behaviour which can easily be mistaken for a bot. Notably, we do not tune the optimal classification threshold, as the outbreak of the war in Ukraine represents an unprecedented event, with an unusual amount of new users joining (see Section \u201cUser Activity\u201d). Hence, we expect the distribution between the target label (bot or human) and our features to be different between the bot training dataset and our Ukrainian dataset. Unfortunately, an extensive manual labelling strategy and more elaborate bot detection is beyond the scope of this work and would warrant its own paper. In summary, with this strategy we remove a total of 2021 users and their tweets from our dataset.To further identify and remove potential spam accounts, we identify all accounts with more than 100 tweets on a single day (the mean is\u2009~\u20094.4 and the median = 2), and remove those 257 users from the dataset. We also noticed an unusual amount of Tweets containing the word \u201cBTS\u201d (45,579; referring to the Korean K-Pop band51) with spikes on specific days, which we subsequently filter out. Next, we identify and remove any tweets published by the same user that contain the exact same text as their previous tweet if both tweets were published within a one minute window. Fifth and finally, we filter out any tweets with the source attribute not being equal to Instagram or Twitter. That way, we discard any tweets automatically published by social media schedulers such as dlvr, which are often used by news agencies or other companies.Statistical modellingTweet modellingWe define the number of tweets Yt,u,l made in week t by user u in language l. As tweets are count data, we model the Yt,u,l to follow a Poisson distribution with intensity \u03bbt,u,l, where$${\\lambda }_{t,u,l}=\\exp (\\mu +{s}_{l}(t)+{W}_{u,l}).$$", "source": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00045-6", "description": "The use of language is innately political, often a vehicle of cultural identity and the basis for nation building.

The Wu,l are language-specific time-constant random intercepts for each user u, assumed to be normally distributed. They capture by how much the average tweeting behaviour (more or less tweets) of each user in each language differs from the general mean \u03bc. Finally, sl(t) denotes a smooth global time trend for each language l (Ukrainian, Russian, English) and captures changes in the tweeting behaviour over all users over time. Hence, with the latter, we can measure behavioural changes of the users over time (e.g. are users tweeting more with the outbreak of the war?), whereas the random intercepts measure changes in the user sample over time (e.g. are users that enter the platform after the war tweeting more on average?). This results in a generalized additive mixel model (GAMM). For more information, we refer the reader to ref. 52 and ref. 53. We fit the model with the R package mgcv v1.8.4154 using the GAM implementation for very large datasets bam. To speed up the estimation, we use the discrete option, which discretizes covariates to ease storage and increase efficiency. For fitting sl(t), we employ thin plate regression splines. Our estimation sample consists of y = 1,045,245 observations, with t = 143 weeks, l = 3 languages and u = 13,643 users. For our fitted model, we report an explained deviance of 71.3%.The effect sizes in the results are calculated as follows. For the behavioural effects we derive the change in sl(t) between two respective dates t1 and t2 and take the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp ({s}_{l}({t}_{2})-{s}_{l}({t}_{1}))\\) for each language l. The result is the change in expected tweeting activity due to behavioural changes, when controlling for the in- and outflux of users. The sample effects are derived by averaging the random effects of the active users at the two respective dates and taking the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp ({\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{2},l}-{\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{1},l})\\). We define \\({\\overline{W}}_{t,l}\\) as the average random effect in language l over all users u active at time point t. This captures the averaged change in expected tweeting activity due to a change in average tweeting intensity of the active users, when controlling for behavioural changes.Language modellingTo model users\u2019 pairwise language probability, we refrain from a multinomial modelling strategy, as even with a weekly setup our dataset is particularly large. (To the best of our knowledge, a package with a parallel estimation routine for large datasets that can fit a GAMM for a multinomial distribution does not exist.) Instead, we model each pairwise probability separately through a binomial distribution. Our pairwise evaluation gives us a total of three different language pairs (UA over RU, UA over EN, RU over EN), for which we model the probability \u03c0 to tweet in language one (subsequently l1) over language two (subsequently l2). The order in which we specify these pairs is irrelevant, as the probability to tweet in l2 over l1 is simply 1\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03c0. More specifically, we define Xt,u as the number of tweets made in week t by user u in l1. We assume Xt,u\u2009~\u2009Binomial(nt,u,\u2009\u03c0t,u), where nt,u denotes the total number of tweets made by user u in week t (sum of tweets in l1 and l2) and \u03c0t,u corresponds to the probability to tweet in l1 over l2. We assume that nt,u is known and instead model \u03c0t,u by setting$${\\pi }_{t,u}=f(\\mu +s(t)+{W}_{u}),$$                    (2)", "source": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00045-6", "description": "The use of language is innately political, often a vehicle of cultural identity and the basis for nation building.

Similarly to before, \u03bc is a general time-constant intercept, which captures the average mean probability over all users and weeks to tweet in l1 over l2. Again, the Wu are time-constant random intercepts for each user u that capture by how much the average probability differs from the general mean \u03bc, and are assumed to be normally distributed. The smooth global time trend s(t) captures changes in the probability over all users over time. Hence, as before, we can measure behavioural changes of the users over time with the latter (are users actively changing the language they are tweeting in?), whereas the random intercepts measure changes in the sample over time (how does the language probability of users entering/leaving the platform evolve?). We estimate this model specification for all three aforementioned language-pairs with the R package mgcv v1.8.4154 using the GAM implementation for very large datasets bam. To speed up the estimation, we use the discrete option, which discretizes covariates to ease storage and increase efficiency. For fitting s(t), we employ thin plate regression splines. Users not tweeting in either of the two languages of the respective language pair, need to be discarded by definition. Hence, for UA over RU our estimation sample consists of of x = 194,178 observations, with t = 143 weeks and u = 10,531 users. For UA over EN: x = 146,984, t = 143, u = 9,133. For RU over EN: x = 170,853, t = 143, u = 10777. For our fitted models, we report explained deviances of: 85.8% (UA over RU), 90.5% (UA over EN) and 90% (RU over EN).The coefficients of a logistic regression, as employed here, must be interpreted with respect to changes in the odds (also known as odds ratio). The odds ratio is defined as odds\u2009=\u2009p/(1\u2009\u2212\u2009p). Hence, it describes how likely an event is going to happen compared to not happen. In this setting, it describes how likely it is to tweet in language 1 over language 2.The effect sizes in the results are calculated as follows. For the behavioural effects we derive the change in s(t) between two respective dates t1 and t2 and take the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp (s({t}_{2})-s({t}_{1}))\\) for each of the three models. The result is the change in odds to tweet in l1 over l2 due to behavioural changes, when controlling for the in- and outflux of users. The sample effects are derived by averaging the random effects of the active users at the two respective dates and taking the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp ({\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{2}}-{\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{1}})\\) for each of the three models. We define \\({\\overline{W}}_{t}\\) as the average random effect over all users u active at time point t. This captures the averaged change in odds due to a change in average tweeting probability of the active users, when controlling for behavioural changes.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.ResultsDescriptive findingsTo determine the language of a tweet, in accordance with the literature55,56, we utilize the language field provided by the Twitter API. Ukrainian (35.8%) and Russian (35.4%) tweets are most prevalent in our dataset, followed by English (11.5%). A large proportion of tweets (11.1%) is labelled as \u201cundefined\u201d, which among others consists of tweets that are too short, contain only hashtags, or only have media links. All other languages have shares of 1.2% or less. For the subsequent analysis we focus on tweets coming from the three main languages (English, Russian, Ukrainian) and discard all remaining tweets. A full breakdown of the language distribution is reported in Supplementary Figure\u00a06.In our dataset, there are clear trends in the aggregate over time (Fig.\u00a01). In the beginning of 2020, we can see that Russian is the predominant language being used on Twitter in Ukraine, however, over time, this number gradually declines. The number of Ukrainian and English tweets on the other hand remains more or less constant over this initial time period. In the figure, we mark two key dates. On 11th November 2021, the United States officially report a mobilization of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border for the first time57,58,59. We will subsequently call this the first signs of aggression. 24th February 2022 marks the begin of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (subsequently referred to as outbreak of the war). As we approach this outbreak, there is a clear spike in tweets across all three languages, with a larger spike in both English and Ukrainian. Afterwards, English and Russian remain mostly constant, although the former on a much higher level than before. For Ukrainian, there is a clear upward trend in the daily number of tweets after the outbreak of the war.Fig. 1: Daily number of tweets in the three most common languages.Russian in red, Ukrainian in blue, English in green. From 9th January to 12th October (1008 days).\u00a0The first vertical line denotes the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border (11th November 2021). The second line denotes the outbreak of the war (24th February 2022).Full size imageGiven these remarkable shifts in the number of tweets in the three considered languages, we want to investigate the underlying factors contributing to these changes. Note, that from the aggregate trends, we can not distinguish whether the observed patterns are due to large in- and outfluxes of users, i.e. user turnover, which are common in online communities40,41,42, or whether the actively tweeting users change their behaviour over time43,44,45. The disentanglement of this question is the aim of the rest of this article.User activityIn order to address this question, we restructure our dataset by aggregating the number of tweets made by each user in English (EN), Ukrainian (UA), and Russian (RU) in each week. (Note, that we employ the Ukrainian country code \u201cUA\u201d instead of the official Ukrainian language tag \u201cUK\u201d in order to avoid confusion.) This allows us to study users\u2019 individual behaviour over time. To obtain reliable results, we restrict the further analysis to users who have tweeted in total at least ten times in any of the three languages. Furthermore, we choose weeks instead of days, as we are interested in general shifts and overall changes in behaviour over time, which are captured sufficiently well on a weekly basis. Through this weekly definition, we can dramatically reduce the size of our dataset, hence more complex modelling approaches become computationally feasible. We drop the first and last week in our dataset as these are incomplete (less than 7 days) and aggregate the remaining tweets on a weekly basis for each user and language. Finally within this, we are only considering weeks in which users are active (we define this as any week in which a user is tweeting at least once, as well as up to two weeks after), in order to account for the times in which users may be inactive for several weeks at a time or abandon their accounts. Thus, our new sample ranges from 13th January 2020 to 10th October 2022 and consists of 143 analysis weeks, 13,643 users and 1,045,245 observations.Using this definition of user activity, we can visualize the total amount of active users as well as turnover rates (switch from active to inactive and vice versa) over time (Fig.\u00a02). In the beginning of 2020, we have around 2800 active users per week. This number gradually decreases to roughly 1,800 until we approach the outbreak of the war. Afterwards, the number of active users starts increasing again. Note the drop and subsequent spike in activity shortly before and with the outbreak of the war. Looking at the turnover rates, we find that there is a constant stream of ~250 (potentially different) users per week that switch from active to inactive and vice versa. The aforementioned spikes are also evident in these turnover rates. Finally, we find that there are roughly 50 users per week that join our sample for the first time and about the same amount that leave it altogether. Both of these numbers almost double after the outbreak of the war.Fig. 2: Weekly user activity graphs.The brown graph reports the number of active users in each week. The blue (red) graph reports the number of users who switch to active (inactive), the green the number of users who switch to active for the first time, the purple the number of users who were active for the last time, i.e. drop out of the sample altogether. All graphs, but particularly the latter two, are skewed upwards respectively downwards towards beginning and end of the study period due to the nature of how the dataset is constructed. Hence, we drop the first and last three weeks for visualization purposes (137 total weeks left). The full plot is available in Supplementary Notes\u00a05.Full size imageTweeting activityTo obtain a better understanding on how the average active Ukrainian Twitter user changes over time, we visualize the average number of published tweets by a user in each language in Fig.\u00a03a. From the figure, we can clearly see that there are substantial shifts. Overall, the average number of RU tweets per user decreases constantly over time (from over 6.5 to 2.1), the outbreak of the war being no exception. The average number of EN tweets decreases slightly until the war, where we notice a sudden uptick (from 0.7 to 2.8), followed by a steady decline. Meanwhile, the number of UA tweets slowly but steadily rises (from 2.4 to 2.9), with steeper increases after the first signs of aggression in November 2021 and no appearance of slowing down (5.3 at the end).Fig. 3: Changes in the number of tweets per user.Russian in red, Ukrainian in blue, English in green.

The second line denotes the outbreak of the war.Full size imageBy combining these findings with Fig.\u00a02, we can at least partially explain the aggregate trends evident in Fig.\u00a01. While the active user sample is shrinking over time, those users that stay (and join) the sample are tweeting more in UA. Hence, there is no decrease in the overall amount of UA tweets. We find the exact opposite for RU tweets. As the number of active users is declining, the users that stay active are tweeting less in RU, resulting in the visible decrease of aggregate RU tweets over time. Notably, so far, we do not know, if those changes in the average amount of tweets per user are simply driven by shifts in our active user sample (i.e., are those users that initially tweet a lot in RU leaving over time and this is why we see this decrease in the average?), or, if these changes are (at least partially) driven by behavioural changes in those users that remain active on Twitter (i.e., are the same users tweeting less in RU over time?).We address this through our tweet model described in Section \u201cTweet Modelling\u201d. We fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to predict the number of tweets made by each user in each language in each week, assuming a Poisson distribution. By incorporating both a smooth global time trend for each language, as well as user-specific random effects for each of the languages, we disentangle sample shifts (random effects) from behavioural changes (global trend). Hence, the former capture any changes in the population of active Ukraine-based Twitter users, while the latter strictly measures how these active users change their behaviour.Figure\u00a03b visualizes the average fitted sample (population) effects, i.e. the graphs depict how the average time-constant tweeting intensity in our active user sample changes over time due to user turnover. The figure shows, that the average RU tweeting intensity is mostly constant over time until November 2021, where aggression starts. From that point onward, in the span of only a few months, we see a decline of 21% in RU tweets from November 2021 to October 2022 (end of study period), solely attributed to changes in the user sample during that period. For EN, we find somewhat of an opposite effect. Similarly, there are only minor fluctuations until November 2021. But afterwards, there is a sharp increase of 107%. Taking a look at UA, we find a long-term increase of about 43% before the aggression starts. This increase comes to a hold shortly before the war, and considerably speeds up in the weeks after (+87%). All (relative) effect sizes calculated between the most relevant dates in our analysis period (start of study period, first signs of aggression, outbreak of war, end of study period) are reported in Table\u00a01. We elaborate on this in Supplementary Notes\u00a06, where we provide an additional figure, which illustrates sample changes over four-weekly intervals (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). From there, we can observe that the largest shifts clearly take place with and after the outbreak of the war. We also provide an alternative to Table\u00a01, which measures the speed of change between the key dates in Supplementary Table\u00a05. A full breakdown of all model coefficients is available in Supplementary Table\u00a07.Table 1 Tweet activity effect sizes between key datesFull size tableNext, we will investigate behavioural changes using Fig.\u00a03c. The graphs depict how the tweeting behaviour of the active users changes throughout the study period, when controlling for the user turnover (sample effects). Starting with RU, we notice that users are tweeting less and less over time. From January 2020 to November 2021, users tweet 49% less in RU due to behavioural changes. Subsequently, we see a small rise with the outbreak of the war (+5%), followed up by an even steeper decline (\u221224%). In contrast, UA is reasonably consistent in its use up until the start of aggression. From there, we observe a surge (+36%) until the outbreak of the war, followed by a gentler increase (+15%) after. Finally, looking more closely at EN tweeting behaviour, we can observe a general downward trend (\u221234%) until November 2021. Once the aggression starts, there is a huge spike (+130%), as users are tweeting a lot more in EN. After the outbreak of the war, this somewhat reverses (\u221240%), however, without dropping back down to pre-aggression levels. A full breakdown of all changes is reported in Table\u00a01. Again, we elaborate in in Supplementary Notes\u00a06. Supplementary Figure\u00a09 shows that the largest behavioural shifts take place shortly before, with, and after the outbreak of the war. As a robustness check, we also pursue two alternative modelling strategies, one using factor smooths instead of random intercepts, the other implementing a regression discontinuity design, which are discussed extensively in Supplementary Notes\u00a02.1 and 2.2 respectively. Both confirm the behavioural patterns described here.Overall, we can conclude that there are only minor sample shifts pre-dating aggression that affect tweeting activity, but major shifts thereafter. In terms of behaviour, we can already observe steady changes early on, which considerably intensify with the war. However, as of yet, we cannot exactly pinpoint where those changes come from. Are users that already tweet in UA simply tweeting more with the outbreak of the war, or is it possible that users are actively switching the language they are tweeting in?Choice of languageWe analyze the choice of language more closely in the following. As we are interested in shifts between the individual languages, we look at the pairwise probability to tweet in one language over another over time. Hence, the probability reports how likely it is that a user tweets in language one (e.g. UA) over language two (e.g. EN). With three languages, this pairwise evaluation gives us a total of three different language pairs (UA over RU, UA over EN, RU over EN), where the order in which we specify each pair is irrelevant. Figure\u00a04a visualizes how these pairwise probabilities evolved for an average user over time. For RU over EN the probability is mostly constant (82% to tweet in RU) until aggression starts, from where it continuously drops down to 58%. For UA over EN we see small increases over time (68\u201372%). With the mobilization of the Russian troops, we see a drop (62%), followed by a rise back to pre-aggression levels months into the war. Finally, for UA over RU we see a completely different pattern. Initially, the probability to tweet in UA is low (32%), from where it continues to rise consistently. In the weeks leading up to the war, there is a considerable speed up in this shift, resulting in a probability of 76% to tweet in UA over RU towards the end of the analysis period in October 2022.Fig. 4: Changes in the choice of language per user (RU over EN in brown, UA over EN in turquoise, UA over RU in purple).RU over EN in brown, UA over EN in turquoise, UA over RU in purple. (a) Visualizes the descriptive average probability to tweet in one language over another, (b) the sample effects (average random effects), (c) the behavioural effects (global trend). The shaded area depicts the 95% confidence interval. The first vertical line denotes the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border. The second line denotes the outbreak of the war.Full size imageSimilarly to before, we can disentangle sample shifts from behavioural changes through statistical modelling. In summary, we fit a GAMM to model users\u2019 pairwise language probability to tweet over time, assuming a binomial distribution. As before, we include a smooth global time trend and user-specific random effects into the model. We fit such a model, for all three aforementioned language-pairs. A full description is provided in Section \u201cLanguage Modelling\u201d.Figure\u00a04b visualizes the fitted average sample effects across all three models, i.e. the graphs depict how the average time-constant tweeting probabilities in the active user sample change over time. As we are working with coefficients of a logistic regression, changes must be interpreted with respect to changes in the odds. The figure shows that for RU over EN, initially, there is only a minor decline (\u221219%). However, as we approach the outbreak of the war, we can report a large drop in the odds, as users are 62% less likely to tweet in RU over EN than before, with further decreases thereafter (\u221229%). For UA over EN, we find a small to moderate increase until aggression (+21%) due to sample shifts, followed by a large drop until war outbreak (\u221252%), which is recovered in the months after (+42%). Finally, for UA over RU, there is a constant increase in the odds over time (+66%), which speeds up once aggression starts (+87% until October 2022). Table\u00a02 details all changes. As before, changes over four-weekly intervals are visualized in Supplementary Fig.\u00a010. The figure shows that the sample effects for the language choice are slightly more erratic, but the major shifts take place with and after war outbreak. The alternative to Table\u00a02, with the speed of changes is available in Supplementary Table\u00a06, the full breakdown of all model coefficients in Supplementary Table\u00a08.Table 2 Language choice effect sizes between key datesFull size tableCombining this with the results from the previous section, we can conclude that the user turnover in the first 1.5 years shifts the sample such that users are more likely to tweet in UA (than RU or EN), but not at the expense of either of the two other languages, as the sample effects for tweeting activity are (mostly) steady for both. As we approach the outbreak of the war, this drastically changes. Then, the user sample clearly shifts away from RU, as users are instead tweeting more in EN (initially) and UA (long-term). Upon further investigation (Supplementary Notes\u00a07 and", "source": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00045-6", "description": "The use of language is innately political, often a vehicle of cultural identity and the basis for nation building. Here, we examine language choice and tweeting activity of Ukrainian citizens based on 4,453,341 geo-tagged tweets from 62,712 users before and during the Russian war in Ukraine, from January 2020 to October 2022. Using statistical models, we disentangle sample effects, arising from the in- and outflux of users on Twitter (now X), from behavioural effects, arising from behavioural changes of the users. We observe a steady shift from the Russian language towards Ukrainian already before the war, which drastically speeds up with its outbreak. We attribute these shifts in large part to users\u2019 behavioural changes. Notably, our analysis shows that more than half of the Russian-tweeting users switch towards Ukrainian with the Russian invasion. We interpret these findings as users\u2019 conscious choice towards a more Ukrainian (online) identity and self-definition of being Ukrainian. A large-scale longitudinal study analysing Ukraine-based Twitter (now X) accounts\u2019 language use prior and during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, shows a behavioural shift away from Russian language to Ukrainian language.", "title": "The Russian war in Ukraine increased Ukrainian language use on social media | Communications Psychology"}, {"page_content": "8), we find that users tweeting in RU start leaving around November 2021 (start of aggression), with EN users joining. The former continue to leave as the war unfolds, with a few of the latter also leaving the sample again over time. This is also reflected in the increase of the UA odds over time (UA over RU consistently, UA over EN as war continues).Figure\u00a04c reports behavioural language changes across all three language pairs, when controlling for the user turnover. For RU over EN we see a constant decline in the odds over time (\u221238% to tweet in RU), which further speeds up once aggression starts (\u221251%). For UA over EN we see the exact opposite, as over time users are more likely to tweet in UA (+64% in odds). This change reverses with the start of aggression and the outbreak of the war (\u221234%), but subsequently reaches pre-aggression levels as the war unfolds. Finally, we can see a clear shift from UA to RU even early on (+129%). This switch becomes even more striking with the outbreak of the war, as users are actively changing their behaviour such that the average user is 249% more likely to tweet in UA over RU in the span of a single year. Table\u00a02 reports all relevant changes. Supplementary Figure\u00a010 similarly illustrates that the biggest behavioural shifts take place around the outbreak of the war, but also that there already is a constant long-term shift from UA towards RU before. Our alternative modelling strategies in Supplementary Notes\u00a02.1 and 2.2 confirm these findings.Connecting these language shifts with the results on tweeting activity, we find that the initial decline in EN and RU tweeting activity is not limited to monolingual users. Instead, users are actively shifting towards UA, by reducing their amount of RU and EN tweets (with a stronger shift from RU than EN respectively). Similarly, the temporary increase in EN tweeting behaviour leading up to the war can be linked to both UA and RU users. Finally and most importantly, the decline of RU and the rise of UA tweeting behaviour that manifests itself with the war is strongly driven by a major language shift (2.5 times increase) from RU to UA.We visualize and demonstrate this substantial behavioural language shift from RU to UA in Figs.\u00a05, 6. Figure\u00a05 plots the language proportion of each user (UA to RU; from 0 to 1) that tweet in either language before (y-axis) and after the war (x-axis). Hence, along the straight black line through the origin we have users that do not switch language (top right UA, bottom left RU), users above the line switch to RU, below the line to UA, with users switching completely from one language to the other being located in either the top left (all tweets in UA to all in RU) or bottom right corner. Statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05, z\u2009>\u20091.96) language shifts from before to after war outbreak are determined using a two-sided z-test with unequal variances on each user\u2019s language proportion, and are marked in the plot (the distributions were assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested). From the figure it becomes evident that there are many users that do not switch language (in both UA and RU), as well as many users clearly switching from RU to UA at various levels, whereas there are only very few switching from UA to RU.Fig. 5: Scatterplot of users\u2019 language proportions before and after the outbreak of the war.We are only considering users who tweet in either RU or UA (or both) before and after (n\u2009=\u20093237). The points are coloured with respect to each user\u2019s shift in language. 1 (orange) denotes a complete shift to UA, \u22121 (green) a complete shift to RU, 0 no shift. The straight line through the origin covers all points without a shift. Significant shifts (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05) using a two-sided z-test with unequal variances on each user\u2019s language proportion are denoted through full (non-empty) points. n\u2009=\u20091808 (821 significant) shifts towards Ukrainian, n = 818 (106 significant) shifts towards Russian. Only RU and UA tweets of each user are considered.Full size imageIn this sample of users who tweet in either RU or UA both before and after the outbreak of the war (3237 users), we have 1363 users who predominately tweet in RU (>80% of tweets) before the war. Of those, 839 (61.6%) tweet more in UA after the war, with 566 (41.5%) reporting a significant behavioural change (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Out of those 850 users, 341 (25%) even switch to predominately tweeting in UA (>80% of tweets), i.e. perform a hard-switch, with 296 (21.7%) statistically significant hard-switches (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). We pick those 296 users and plot their weekly language proportion over time in Fig.\u00a06. Red points denote 100% of the tweets being phrased in RU, blue points denote the same in UA. From the figure, we can clearly see a substantial break and change in behaviour around the time the war breaks out (second black line), as most of the users switch from RU to UA around this mark.Fig. 6: Scatterplot of users\u2019 language proportion in each week over time.Each row (on the y-axis) denotes one of the n\u2009=\u2009295 users with a statistically significant hard-switch from RU to UA. The points are coloured with respect to each user\u2019s language proportion in the respective week (145 total weeks). Blue = 100% Ukrainian, red = 0% Ukrainian (=100% Russian). Missing points indicate that a user was not tweeting in the respective week. Only RU and UA tweets of each user are considered. The first vertical line denotes the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border. The second line denotes the outbreak of the war.Full size imageOn Ukrainian side, we have 1172 users who predominately tweet in UA (>80% of tweets) before the war. Of those, 471 (40.2%) tweet more in RU after the war, with only 83 (7.1%) reporting a significant behavioural change (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). More importantly, we only observe 35 (3%) hard-switches, out of which 20 (1.7%) are significant (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Hence, there are only very few UA tweeting users for which we can report a significant switch towards RU after the war.Finally, we analyze potential differences in those RU users that perform a hard-switch to UA from those that do not (see Table\u00a03). We find that there are significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the median in various user characteristics between the two groups using a two-sided chi-squared test (no distributional assumptions required). Users switching have more followers (+54.5%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20098.223, p\u2009=\u20090.004), a higher tweet frequency (+47.7%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20095.352, p\u2009=\u20090.021) as well as a higher like frequency (+48.9%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20095.352, p\u2009=\u20090.021) and published more Ukraine geo-tagged tweets during the study period (+49.1%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u200910.639, p\u2009=\u20090.001), whereas there are only small non-significant differences in account age (+12.2%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20093.196, p\u2009=\u20090.07) and followings (+13.8%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20092.023, p\u2009=\u20090.16).Table 3 Median % differences in user characteristicsFull size tableWe also conduct a multilingual topic modelling on the tweets using BERTopic49. The method and its results are thoroughly described in Supplementary Notes\u00a01. We find two topic clusters referencing the war (topic #1 and topic #3). The former is mostly related to updates regarding the situation, asking for help, and supporting the people of Ukraine, the latter covers a more political side of the overall conflict. Both topics are in total more discussed by those RU users that switch language (+62.5%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u200922.061, p\u2009<\u20090.001; +100%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20097.312, p\u2009=\u20090.007). However, once we control for their total amount of tweets in our dataset, i.e. we compute a relative share of war related tweets for each user, the differences shrink and turn non-significant (+4.71%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20090.063, p\u2009=\u20090.801; +17.6%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20090.543, p\u2009=\u20090.461).DiscussionIn our work, we collected geo-tagged tweets from Ukraine and analyzed tweeting activity and language choice before and during the Russian war in Ukraine from 9th January 2020 to 12th October 2022. Due to the nature of our longitudinal dataset and our methodological approach using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM), we were able to disentangle and quantify shifts in the user sample, arising from user turnover, from behavioural changes of the actively tweeting users. Our GAMMs were able to handle the large sample size and take care of user\u2019s varying periods of inactivity within the study period, while at the same time allowing for a flexible non-linear but interpretable model fit.Our analysis shows a steady long-term shift away from Russian towards Ukrainian already before the war, as the Ukrainian tweet probability rises substantially (vs. Russian; 33% to 48%). This shift is majorly driven by behavioural changes. The actively tweeting users reduce their number of Russian tweets in favour of Ukrainian over time. This is likely a conscious choice and thus shift in how the users communicate and present themselves to their online audience26,27,28,29,31. This finding is also in line with trends observed over a 20-year period between the 1989 and the last conducted census in 200136 and more recently across surveys37, where the share of people reporting Ukrainian as their native language perpetually rose over time. Notably, with the Euromaidan protests and the subsequent Russian military intervention in 2014, this shift seems to have sped up, as citizens ethnonational identification and everyday language use is substantially shifting towards Ukrainian. This recent shift towards Ukrainian has also been identified in a small qualitative study on Facebook posts60. We can confirm these findings quantitatively both at-scale and in an ecologically valid setting.We find this gradual shift to drastically speed up with the start of Russian aggression in November 2021 and the subsequent outbreak of the war. In the span of a few months, Ukrainian tweet probability rises from 48% to a remarkable 76%. While some of this increase can be explained by Russian tweeting users leaving and Ukrainian", "source": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00045-6", "description": "The use of language is innately political, often a vehicle of cultural identity and the basis for nation building.

Notably, we show that out of those users predominately tweeting in Russian before the war, roughly half of them tweet more in Ukrainian after. Strikingly, around a quarter of them switch to predominately tweeting in Ukrainian, i.e., they are performing a hard-switch. It is worth noting, that we do not observe more than a handful of switches in the other direction. This shift from Russian to Ukrainian is in line with news reports and small-scale surveys outlining the war as the cause for the recent changes in language use across Ukraine38,39. We theorize that this is a highly politicized response. Users want to distance themselves from any support of the war by no longer using Russian, and consciously change their self-expressed (online) identity26,27,28,29,31, as also already to some extent reported after the Russian military intervention in 2014 both on- and offline37,60 and confirmed in our study through the gradual shift before the war. However, with the Russian invasion, this shift seems to have sped up massively. Moreover, the distancing from supporting the war may also explain why Russian users that perform a hard-switch to Ukrainian seem to be more active on Twitter (including discussions on the war) and have a larger follower base (median of 119 vs. 77). Pressure and general interactions on social media were already reported among the main reasons for the language switch after 201460. Note, that this might also (partially) explain the sample of active users shifting from Russian towards Ukrainian (sample effects).In addition, we observe a long-term behavioural shift away from English tweeting activity up until November 2021. This could be interpreted as a reduction in talking to a broader international audience during that time61,62,63, due to the fact that English is the most widely understood language on the internet by far31,64. However, not surprisingly, with the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border and specifically in the weeks leading up to the war, with a spike during outbreak, we observe a substantial shift towards English. We hypothesize users wanted to let the world know what was happening and called for aid31, which is supported by the fact that we observe a heavy spike in English tweets assigned to the first war topic (more related to help, support and updates). While we record a large influx of English speaking users during that time (+35% in number of tweets), we can also see a substantial behavioural shift (+130%). Already active users tweet substantially more in English, independent of the language they were normally tweeting in. As the war continues to unfold, this somewhat reverses, with some of the newly joined English users leaving and behaviour reverting, although not to pre-aggression levels. With the world being more aware of the situation, and the international community supporting Ukraine in various ways65,66, users likely have less reasons to continue tweeting in English. Instead, they return back to intra-national discussions and thus their native language(s).LimitationsWe recognize that while our study provides a strong foundation towards a better understanding on how the Ukrainian population reacted to the Russian invasion both on- and offline, possible limitations need to be acknowledged. The sample of users investigated here is not representative of the entire Ukrainian population. Indeed, it is skewed towards the younger and middle-aged part of the population (aged 18-49, see also Section \u201cUser Characteristics\u201d). Additionally, we want to emphasize that geo-information is not included on most Twitter clients by default, which might further skew the sample. As on most other social media platforms, users have the option to create new accounts, which we cannot match to their prior ones. Hence, some of the behavioural effects might even be underestimated and instead accounted for as sample effects. Moreover, users might stop tweeting (with Ukrainian geo-information) for various reasons (e.g. because they fled the country). One should keep in mind that the behavioural language shifts taking place with the outbreak of the war are only demonstrated for those users who continue to tweet at and/or after the outbreak, which could potentially lead to a selection bias. Future work may analyze the content and sentiment of the tweets more closely. This could be augmented through the use of media objects attached to the tweets such as images and videos. An investigation of retweet and follower networks may reveal additional differences between those users that are shifting language to those that are not. Naturally, any analysis can be repeated and extended to other social media platforms.ConclusionIn summary, our work investigated tweeting activity and language choice on Ukrainian Twitter before and during the Russian war in Ukraine through a large-scale longitudinal study. We demonstrate substantial shifts away from the Russian language to Ukrainian, which we interpret as users\u2019 conscious choice towards a more Ukrainian (online) identity. More than half of the predominately Russian-tweeting users shift towards Ukrainian, and a quarter of them even perform a hard-switch to Ukrainian, as the war breaks out. This can be seen as citizens\u2019 increasing opposition to Russia and a return to the country\u2019s linguistic roots as well as a push towards a conscious self-definition of being Ukrainian.", "source": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00045-6", "description": "The use of language is innately political, often a vehicle of cultural identity and the basis for nation building.

Here, we examine language choice and tweeting activity of Ukrainian citizens based on 4,453,341 geo-tagged tweets from 62,712 users before and during the Russian war in Ukraine, from January 2020 to October 2022. Using statistical models, we disentangle sample effects, arising from the in- and outflux of users on Twitter (now X), from behavioural effects, arising from behavioural changes of the users. We observe a steady shift from the Russian language towards Ukrainian already before the war, which drastically speeds up with its outbreak. We attribute these shifts in large part to users\u2019 behavioural changes. Notably, our analysis shows that more than half of the Russian-tweeting users switch towards Ukrainian with the Russian invasion.

If found guilty, they face up to 12 years in prison.The investigation comes as Kyiv attempts to clamp down on corruption in a bid to speed up its membership in the European Union and NATO. Officials from both blocs have demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join them.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected on an anti-corruption platform in 2019, long before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both the president and his aides have portrayed the recent firings of top officials, notably that of Ivan Bakanov, former head of the State Security Service, in July 2022, as proof of their efforts to crack down on graft.

Ukrainian authorities said that 230 Ukrainian prisoners of war returned home in the first exchange in almost five months. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that 248 Russian servicemen have been freed under the deal sponsored by the United Arab Emirates.The UAE\u2019s Foreign Ministry attributed the successful swap to the \u201cstrong friendly relations between the UAE and both the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ukraine, which were supported by sustained calls at the highest levels.\u201d The UAE has maintained close economic ties with Moscow despite Western sanctions and pressure on Russia after it launched its invasion in 2022.Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said it was the 49th prisoner exchange during the war. Some of the Ukrainians had been held since 2022. Among them were some of those who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine\u2019s Snake Island and the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.Russian officials offered no other details of the exchange.

Vyacheslav Gladkov, writing on Telegram. \u201cAir defense systems worked,\u201d he said, promising more details about possible damage after inspecting the area later in the day, part of a New Year\u2019s holiday week in Russia.Ukraine fired two Tochka-U missiles and seven rockets at the region late Tuesday, followed by six Tochka-U missiles and six Vilkha rockets on Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said.The Soviet-built Tochka-U missile system has a range of up to 120 kilometers (75 miles) and a warhead that can carry cluster munitions. Ukraine has received some cluster munitions from the United States but the Tochka-U and Vilkha can use their own cluster munitions.The Russian side of the frontier has come under increasingly frequent attack in recent days. Throughout the war, border villages have sporadically been targeted by Ukrainian artillery fire, rockets, mortar shells and drones launched from thick forests where they are hard to detect.Lately, as Russia fired missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities, Kyiv\u2019s troops have aimed at Belgorod\u2019s regional capital, which is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city.Belgorod, with a population of about 340,000, is the biggest Russian city near the border. It can be reached by relatively simple and movable weapons such as multiple rocket launchers.On Saturday, shelling of Belgorod killed 25 people, including five children, in one of the deadliest strikes on Russian soil since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion. Another civilian was killed Tuesday in a new salvo.Hitting Belgorod and disrupting city life is a dramatic way for Ukraine to show it can strike back against Russia, whose military outnumbers and outguns Kyiv\u2019s forces.The tactic appeared to be having some success, with signs the attacks are unsettling the public, political leaders and military observers.On Monday, Putin lashed out against the Belgorod attacks by Ukraine. \u201cThey want to intimidate us and create uncertainty within our country,\u201d he said, promising to step up retaliation.Answering a question from a soldier who asked him about civilian casualties in Belgorod, Putin said: \u201cI also feel a simmering anger.\u201dMany Russian military bloggers have expressed regret about Moscow\u2019s withdrawal from the border area in September 2022 amid a swift counteroffensive by Kyiv, and they have argued that more territory must be seized to secure Belgorod and other border areas.Russia describes Ukrainians as \u201cterrorists\u201d who indiscriminately target residential areas while insisting Moscow only aims at depots, arms factories and other military facilities \u2014 even though there is ample evidence that Russia is hitting Ukrainian civilian targets.Ukrainian officials rarely acknowledge responsibility for strikes on Russian territory.In another Russian border region on Wednesday, the city of Zeleznogorsk was briefly cut off from the power grid after Ukrainian shelling, local officials said.Authorities were forced to temporarily shut down an electricity substation in the city of 100,000 people in the Kursk region to repair the damage from an aerial attack, Kursk Gov. Roman Starovoit said on Telegram.Residents were without power or heat, he said, although electricity was restored in most of the city about two hours later, he said.", "source": "https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-belgorod-e1fab1a1968fc272fd49687399e4cc78", "description": "Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war in the biggest single release of captives since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.", "title": "Russia-Ukraine exchange hundreds of prisoners of war | AP News"}, {"page_content": "Russia has recently intensified its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, including using Kinzhal missiles which can fly at 10 times the speed of sound. The Kremlin\u2019s forces appear to be targeting Ukraine\u2019s defense industry, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Wednesday.The onslaught has prompted Kyiv officials to ask its Western allies to provide further air defense support.NATO announced Wednesday that it would help member nations buy up to 1,000 surface-to-air Patriot guided missiles in a deal possibly costing about $5.5 billion. That could allow alliance members to send more of their own defense systems to Ukraine.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

With some reports still pending verification, it said, the increase was likely higher.Danielle Bell who heads the U.N.\u2019s monitoring mission. said: \u201cCivilian casualties had been steadily decreasing in 2023 but the wave of attacks i n late December and early January violently interrupted that trend.\u201dThe U.N. mission said it is verifying reports the recent intense Russian missile and drone attacks that began hitting populated areas across Ukraine on Dec. 29 and continued into early January killed 86 civilians and injured 416 others.\u201cThese attacks sow death and destruction on Ukraine\u2019s civilians who have endured profound losses from Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion for almost two years now,\u201d Bell said.

On Jan. 4, it said, Russian missiles struck the small town of Pokrovsk and nearby village of Rivne close to the front lines, burying two families \u2013 six adults and five children \u2013 in the rubble of their homes. Some bodies have still not been found, it said.In another attack on Jan. 6, the blast wave from a Russian missile strike in Novomoskovsk injured 31 civilians including eight passengers on a minibus that was destroyed during the morning commute, the U.N. said.The confirmed number of civilians killed since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022 is more than 10,200, including 575 children, and the number of injured is over 19,300, the U.N. humanitarian office\u2019s operations director, Edem Wosornu, told the U.N. Security Council last Wednesday.Neither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each is at pains to amplify the other side\u2019s casualties as the nearly two-year war grinds on with no sign of peace talks to end the conflict.

Zelenskyy confirmed in an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI TV released late Sunday that he was thinking about removing Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the popular commander-in-chief of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. He said he was contemplating the move to ensure the country remains led by individuals who are \u201cconvinced of victory\u201d against Russia. \u201cA reset, a new beginning is necessary,\u201d Zelenskyy said. The review is \u201cnot about a single person but about the direction of the country\u2019s leadership.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking about this replacement, but you can\u2019t say here we replaced a single person,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cWhen we talk about this, I mean a replacement of a series of state leaders, not just in a single sector like the military. If we want to win, we must all push in the same direction, convinced of victory. We cannot be discouraged, let our arms fall. We must have the right positive energy.\u201d                    RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR                What\u2019s in the bipartisan Senate package to aid Ukraine, secure U.S. borderSenators release a border and Ukraine deal but the House speaker declares it \u2018dead on arrival\u2019Shelling kills at least 28 at bakery in Russian-occupied Ukraine, Moscow-installed officials sayZelenskyy\u2019s comments were his first acknowledgement of Zaluzhnyi,'s possible firing. The potential ouster of the general already has caused an uproar in Ukraine and delighted the Kremlin as the war approaches its second anniversary. Zaluzhnyi is widely respected among Ukrainian service members and considered a national hero. He is credited with stalling Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in the early days of the war and expertly pushing back Moscow\u2019s troops. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko criticized the possibility of Zaluzhnyi\u2019s firing, saying it was due to the general\u2019s leadership that \u201cmany Ukrainians truly trust the armed forces.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy poses for a photo with servicemen during his visit to Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, Feb. 4, 2024.

His firing could risk degrading morale at a critical time in the war.According to Ukrainian and Western media reports, Zelenskyy asked Zaluzhnyi to resign last week, but the general refused. Zaluzhnyi has not commented publicly on the reports. Tensions between him and the president have been rising since a much anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive, which was launched in June with the help of an array of Western weapons, failed to produce major territory gains in Russian-occupied areas, disappointing allies. Ukraine now is grappling with ammunition and personnel shortages while Russia is on the offensive, mounting relentless attacks. Four people were killed and at least one was injured in a Monday afternoon strike over the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, the head of the local military administration said. The need for a broad mobilization to beef up the number of Ukrainian troops has reportedly been one of the areas of disagreement between Zelenskyy and Zaluzhnyi. Zelenskyy said at the end of last year that he had turned down the military\u2019s request to marshal up to 500,000 people, demanding more details about how the mobilization would be organized and paid for.A rift between Zaluzhnyi and Zelenskyy first broke into the open in the fall when the general acknowledged in an interview with The Economist that the fighting with Russia had stalemated. The president strongly denied that was the case. For his part, Zaluzhnyi has published two essays laying out his vision for how Ukraine can win the war. In his writings, he said it was critical for Ukraine to have air superiority, to extending its efficiency in countering enemy artillery, to build up reserves and to increase electronic warfare capabilities.Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren announced Monday that the Netherlands was preparing six additional F-16 fighter jets to give Ukraine on top of 18 the country previously pledged. Ukraine\u2019s \u201caerial superiority is essential for countering Russian aggression,\u201d Ollongren said in a message on X, formerly Twitter. Denmark also has promised to donate 19 F-16s to Ukraine. Lt. Gen. Serhii Nayev, the commander of the Ukrainian military\u2019s joint forces, said Monday that the country was set to receive missiles with a range of 300 to 500 kilometers (186 to 310 miles) along with the F-16s as part of upcoming defense aid packages from its allies, according to Ukrainian news agency RBK-Ukraine.Ukraine desperately needs more Western military assistance as Russian forces maneuver from many directions along the drawn-out war\u2019s 1,500-kilometer (900-mile) front line. House Republicans in the U.S. are moving forward with a military spending package that provides aid to Israel but leaves out more help for Ukraine. Zaluzhnyi\u2019s dismissal could fuel further uncertainty among Western allies.Russia has rejoiced at the prospect, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that the talk about Zaluzhnyi\u2019s dismissal exposed rifts in the Ukrainian leadership. The Ukrainska Pravda newspaper reported Monday that Zelenskyy also was considering the removal of General Staff Chief Serhii Shaptala.Zaluzhnyi on Monday congratulated Shaptala on his birthday and posted a picture of them together on Facebook.\u201cIt will still be very difficult for us, but we will definitely never be ashamed,\u201d Zaluzhnyi wrote.___Follow AP\u2019s Russia-Ukraine coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Now, as Ukraine heads into the third year of defending itself against Russia\u2019s aggression, the suggestion persists \u2013 but increasingly, it\u2019s the west that needs the off-ramp.Ukraine\u2019s prospects, after two years of a gruelling war that have taken an enormous human toll, are uncertain. Its population losses, both in terms of battlefield casualties and the flood of emigration that followed the invasion, will be difficult to remedy, and could have crippling consequences for Ukraine\u2019s already struggling economy. Not only that but the cost of the war is increasing at a staggering rate. The latest joint assessment by the EU, World Bank and UN of Ukraine\u2019s recovery needs puts these at US$486 billion (\u00a3385.6 billion), up $75 billion since last year. This means Ukraine\u2019s needs have grown in 12 months by one and a half times the total amount the EU has made available in support for Ukraine over the next four years. According to the annual index of risks for 2023 produced by the Munich Security Conference, a global forum for debating international security policy, Russia was perceived as the top risk by five of the G7 countries. In 2024, this perception is only shared by two G7 members. Given the absolutely critical dependence of Ukraine on G7 political, economic and military support, this is worrying. It does not bode well for the ability of Europe\u2019s political leaders to sustain the necessary public backing for continued aid transfers. Voters in France and Germany, for example, are significantly more concerned about mass migration and radical Islamic terrorism than Putin\u2019s designs for Ukraine. Moreover, Ukraine is not the only crisis demanding the attention of the collective west. The war in Gaza and wider conflagration across the Middle East is, and will remain, high on the agenda. But there are numerous other flashpoints that often fail to grab global news headlines. The ongoing civil war in Sudan, the intensifying conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and rising tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia all have the potential to feed directly into the fear of western publics about yet another mass migration crisis.Nuclear sabre rattling by North Korea, Iranian sponsorship of terrorist proxies across the Middle East, and the apparent consolidation of a new \u201caxis of evil\u201d between these two and Russia are unlikely to calm nerves in western capitals.Costly distractionAgainst this background, the war in Ukraine has become a major and increasingly costly distraction. Many leaders \u2013 in Europe in particular \u2013 are worried, perhaps disproportionately, about a return of Donald Trump to the White House and the possible end of a meaningful transatlantic alliance. If the US withdraws support, there is a fear that a continuation of the war in Ukraine could expose Europe even more to Russian aggression than is already the case.The key problem is that mere rhetorical commitments to supporting Ukraine are not just meaningless but counterproductive. They uphold the mirage of a winnable war without providing the required capabilities. As the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Munich Security Conference on February 17, the military equipment shortages that Ukraine has experienced over the last several months were a key factor in the recent loss of the town of Avdiivka to Russian forces. The loss of the town of Avdiivka will not shift the frontlines of the war much, but is a huge blow to Ukrainian morale.Institute for the Study of WarThe frontline may not have shifted more than a few hundred metres as a result of this loss, but the psychological impact is significant \u2013 including in the west, where doubts over the will and ability to sustain Ukraine\u2019s efforts are on the rise again. If the conflict continues on its current trajectory \u2013 and even more so if the narrative of an unwinnable war gains more traction \u2013 western support is unlikely even to prevent Ukraine from losing badly, possibly leading to the kind of total defeat Putin imagined in his recent interview with Tucker Carlson.A Ukrainian defeat would be a dangerous humiliation for the west. In light of the continuing rhetoric about the west\u2019s \u201ciron-clad commitment\u201d to a just peace for Ukraine, a Russian victory would accelerate the decline of the current international order. It would usher in a drawn-out transition period to something far less favourable \u2013 and not just to western interests. A return to the bloc confrontation of the cold war \u2013 but with a probably stronger Chinese-led alliance with Russia, Iran and North Korea facing off against a weakening and less united western alliance \u2013 would leave little room to address problems such as climate change and food security. This should also be a warning to those in the global south who think they have little, if anything, at stake in Ukraine. Compromise solutionSearching for an off-ramp does not mean letting Putin win. It means enabling Ukraine to defend the areas currently still under its control. This will require more western aid, but also serious consideration of negotiating a ceasefire. An end to the fighting would buy western Europe and Ukraine time to build up stronger domestic defence capabilities. Ukraine has concluded bilateral security deals with the UK, France and Germany \u2013 and deals with other G7 members are likely to follow. These deals would provide more of a guarantee for Ukrainian democracy and sovereignty than the currently futile attempt to restore the country\u2019s territorial integrity in full \u2013 or its hopes for imminent Nato membership that are unlikely to be fulfilled. Reassessing current realities on the battlefield in this way will undoubtedly be seen as appeasement by some. But a more fitting analogy might be that of West Germany in 1949 and, even more so, of South Korea in 1953, both of which needed to establish internationally recognised borders in order to establish sovereignty in the face of hostile neighbouring powers. The challenge for Ukraine and its western partners is to establish the equivalent of the Korean peninsula\u2019s 38th parallel. The alternative, short of the west seriously doubling down on military support for Kyiv, is a slow and agonising defeat on the battlefield, with far-reaching consequences beyond Ukraine.NATORussiaVladimir PutinUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraine invasion 2022Give me perspectiveWant to write?

As he lifted two grenades in the air, a Ukrainian drone swept in from above and exploded.Soon, the smoke cleared, a surveillance drone overhead showed, revealing the Russian soldier\u2019s corpse. That day\u2019s attack, just north of the destroyed city of Avdiivka, was repelled. But the Ukrainians were under no illusions: There would be many more.\u201cThey come in waves,\u201d said Lt. Oleksandr Shyrshyn, 29, the deputy battalion commander in the 47th Mechanized Brigade. \u201cAnd they do not stop.\u201dAs the war enters its third year, Ukrainians find themselves outmanned and outgunned. After dominating the fighting in the first year and battling mostly to a standstill in the second, they have relinquished the momentum to Russia. Now they are digging in and fighting to hold on.Mortar crews need to ration artillery shells. Troops are being rotated from units in the rear to join undermanned infantry units at the front, and there are shortages of critical supplies needed to repair and maintain Ukraine\u2019s armored vehicles.ImageUkrainian soldiers next to a Russian tank outside Bakhmut, in territory where the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade counterattacked and regained control.ImageMonths of artillery battles outside Bakhmut have left fields riddled with craters.ImageA soldier with the 93rd Mechanized Brigade at a bunkered Ukrainian position outside Bakhmut.Because the Ukrainians are critically short of ammunition, for instance, they cannot afford to fire at only one or two advancing enemy soldiers, so the Russians have adapted and often move in small numbers to their most forward positions. They try to amass enough soldiers to storm a Ukrainian trench and overwhelm the defenders.\u201cNow, we don\u2019t have enough equipment, enough people to go on the offensive,\u201d Lieutenant Shyrshyn said. \u201cSo the main goal, for now, is to hold the position we have.\u201dKyiv recently announced the allocation of nearly $500 million to build fortifications along its border with Russia and to create a deeper defensive line in the eastern Donbas region that can serve as fallback positions should the Russians achieve a major breakthrough.The epicenter of the fighting remains around Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region, where the Russians have staged relentless assaults, no matter the obstacles. They spent weeks fighting for control of an industrial slag heap on the outskirts of the city, sending waves of troops up only to be cut down in horrifying fusillades. They creep through tunnels under the city streets and direct unmanned vehicles packed with explosives at Ukrainian positions.It is all in the pursuit of another annihilated city. But their attacks in Avdiivka and elsewhere along the front serve a larger goal: to seize the advantage at a time American military support to Ukraine has ceased, and to overwhelm the Ukrainians with sheer mass.ImageVuhledar, a ruined city and a key hot spot on the eastern front. ImageA civilian in his apartment in Vuhledar.ImageAbout 150 civilians remain in Vuhledar.While they are now almost exclusively engaged in defensive operations, Ukrainian soldiers interviewed along the front said that did not mean they could simply hunker down. They are seeking to inflict maximum pain on Russian forces while avoiding prolonged battles that could result in their own steep losses.For the moment, Russian forces are achieving only marginal gains despite pouring enormous amounts of resources into their winter offensive.Last month, journalists from The New York Times were able to watch several recent battles with commanders and drone operators around Avdiivka and another ruined city, Vuhledar \u2014 two key hot spots on the eastern front. The scope of the Russian losses was evident in the fields of ruined armor and the broken bodies of soldiers littering snow covered fields.The Ukrainians are using mines and other obstacles to channel Russian armor into kill zones, where they can be hit with heavy guns nearly every time they mount an armored assault. They are aggressively using Western-supplied fighting vehicles and tanks as hunter-killers when Russian troops get close to the Ukrainian positions.Since the Russians are now able to fire five times as many shells as the Ukrainians in some parts of the front, according to artillery units working on the front, the Ukrainians have had to increasingly turn to bomb-laden drones piloted remotely, known as FPVs, to try to plug the gap.ImageThe people who live in Vuhledar rely on occasional aid, delivered at significant risk by volunteers, to survive the winter.ImageVuhledar has come under greater pressure since the capture of another town, Marinka.ImageResidents in the city are without electricity, water or any city services to rely on.But the Ukrainian firepower is still limited. Major Serhii Bets, 30, the chief of staff of the 48th Separate Rifle Battalion of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, said that the drones were an effective tool but could not be compared with the big guns.\u201cA first-person drone will not disassemble the dugout, will not mow the tree line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not exert such psychological pressure on the enemy. And we don\u2019t have a lot of FPV crews\u201dThe Russians also still dominate the skies and, after a brief pause following the downing of several Russian fighter jets, the aerial bombardments have resumed, soldiers said.Scores of giant craters left by 1,000-pound bombs in annihilated villages testify to the destructive force that Russia continues to bring to bear.While it is unclear how long Kyiv can sustain its defense if its Western allies do not continue to provide robust military support, Ukrainian forces continue to inflict heavy damage on Russian forces while mostly holding the line.Since Russia began renewed offensive operations in October, it has lost 365 main battle tanks and some 700 armored vehicles, \u201cbut only achieved minor territorial gains,\u201d the British military intelligence agency said last Monday.More than 13,000 Russian soldiers were killed and wounded in only two months of operations aimed at capturing Avdiivka, according to a declassified American intelligence assessment released in December. That works out to about 3,000 Russian casualties for every square mile of territorial gains.ImageAs the war enters its third year, Ukrainians find themselves outmanned and outgunned.ImageAfter dominating the fighting in the first year of the war and battling mostly to a standstill in the second, the Ukrainians have relinquished the momentum to Russia.ImageUkrainian soldiers with the 72nd Mechanized Brigade refitting at a frontline position in a building in Vuhledar.Still, the British intelligence agency warned that Russia would most likely be able to \u201ccontinue this level of offensive activity for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u201cIf the Russians are interested in a particular section of the front, they will raze it to the ground,\u201d said Major Bets of the rifle battalion, pointing to a screen showing live drone footage to illustrate his point.\u201cSince mid-December, the Russians have completely destroyed this tree line,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look around the tree line in a radius of 100 by 100, there is just plowed land.\u201d But, he said, Ukrainian defenders are \u201cdigging holes to live somehow, holding on.\u201dStill, even small Russian gains pose risks for Ukraine. The capture of Marinka \u2014 a town near Avdiivka outside the city of Donetsk \u2014 after years of fighting has allowed the Russians to open up a new line of attack on another town, Vuhledar, from the north.\u201cThe enemy has partially succeeded,\u201d Major Bets said. \u201cWe will not hide it.\u201dThey use their advantage in artillery to \u201cdisorient our guys in the trenches, and then the infantry comes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are fighting against the infantry calmly and holding our ground.\u201d\u201dIt is no secret that the Kremlin\u2019s strategy is to outlast the Ukrainians, and its forces are keenly aware of Ukrainian artillery shortages, soldiers said, repeatedly adjusting tactics to try to gain an advantage.As cannon fire thundered above ground last week in Avdiivka, more than 150 Russians crept through a narrow pipe underground to an important Ukrainian fortified position in a recreational facility called \u201cThe Tsar\u2019s Hut.\u201dImageA woman who collected wood pieces from a tree that was bombed in Vuhledar, with her dog. ImageAs supplies and ammunition dwindle, Ukrainians said they would have to pay a higher price in blood to simply hold their lines.ImageFor the moment, Russian forces are achieving only marginal gains despite pouring enormous amounts of resources into their winter offensive.They emerged behind the Ukrainians and ambushed them, according to both sides.

So Here Are Mine For 2024By Michael Peck January 24, 2024Here\u2019s a guaranteed way to lose money: bet on  the future of the Ukraine war. Others have made the same bet, and they lost big time. Remember those confident predictions by experts that Russia would take Kyiv in a week? Two years later, that Russia can barely hang on to Crimea.\u00a0\u00a0Or that Europe would sacrifice Ukraine in return for cheap Russian energy? Tell that to Russian troops being blasted by British missiles and German tanks. Those fancy Western weapons would enable Ukraine\u2019s summer 2023 counteroffensive to liberate Crimea and drive Putin\u2019s legions back into Russia? A glance at a map will tell you how well that went.\u00a0So in that spirit, this writer offers of a few predictions of his own. It\u2019s a win-win proposition: being right will be proof of sagacity and foresight. And being wrong can\u2019t be any more wrong than most everyone else has been.\u00a0\u00a0Prediction 1: The War Will Continue.Putin has invested his political life \u2014 and possibly his physical wellbeing \u2014 on doing to Kyiv what the Red Army did to Berlin. Ukraine is tired and wants peace, but Ukrainians need something positive to show for their efforts, such as liberating Crimea, rather than dying simply to stave off a predatory megalomaniac in the Kremlin.\u00a0\u00a0Barring some decisive battlefield event, it\u2019s hard to imagine a negotiated peace that both sides will accept at this point. This war will eventually end, as all wars do. But not in 2024.\u00a0Prediction 2: The Stalemate Will Continue.\u00a0\u00a0The more that Ukraine and Russia have striven for victory, the greater the stalemate. This is partly due to structural defects in both armies, such as poor tactics and lack of resources.\u00a0\u00a0And because of the diffusion of technologies such as drones and GPS-guided munitions that make movement in the open risky and encourage troops to hunker down. Either way, the result is likely to be continued trench warfare and costly battles fought over little-known villages.\u00a0Get the LatestSign up to receive regular emails and stay informed about CEPA's work.Email  \u0394Prediction 3: There Will Be More Disappointing Wonder Weapons.\u00a0\u00a0Can you guess what 2024\u2019s Wonder Weapon of the Year will be? Previous contestants have included drones, HIMARS rockets, hypersonic missiles, and even old Leopard tanks and Bradley troop carriers. How well they have transformed the war can be seen in Prediction 2 (\u201cstalemate\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The frontrunner for this year is probably Artificial Intelligence, which promises to make smart bombs smarter and the targeting process for them faster. Judging by history, either Ukraine or Russia \u2013 more likely Ukraine, with Western help \u2013 will reap a brief AI advantage until the other side either copies the technology or learns to nullify it.\u00a0Prediction 4: The US and Europe Will Continue to Support Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0The rise of far-right parties in Europe, and the possible reelection of Donald Trump, can only worry Kyiv. But for democratic countries, betraying allies leaves a bad taste: witness how Chamberlain went down in history after Munich, or how Americans politics was roiled over who lost Nationalist China, South Vietnam and Afghanistan.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s easy for some right-wing leaders to denounce aiding Ukraine \u2014 as long they\u2019re not the party in power. Stick them with the responsibility for handing Ukraine over to Putin, and they may sing a different tune.\u00a0Prediction 5: The World\u2019s Attention Will Shift to Another Conflict.\u00a0\u00a0This has already happened, as media coverage of the Gaza war has drowned out the once-gushing stream of news about Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0In turn, the focus on Gaza may shift to potential conflicts between Israel and Iran, Iran and America, and China, Taiwan and America. But it\u2019s just as likely that an unexpected conflict will arise somewhere else to draw world attention.\u00a0\u00a0Something will happen somewhere.

We will intensify strikes. Not a single crime against our civilian population will go unpunished,\u201d the Russian leader said, describing the barrage of Belgorod as a \u201cterrorist act.\u201dRussia has blamed Ukraine for Saturday\u2019s attack, which was one of the deadliest to take place on Russian soil since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine started more than 22 months ago. Russian officials said the death toll stood at 25 as of Monday, including five children.

No. We are hitting military targets, and that\u2019s what we will keep doing.\u201dBoth Ukraine and Russia have relied extensively on explosive droves during the war. The wave of Russian attacks in Ukraine continued throughout the day Monday. A 15-year-old boy was killed and seven people wounded after falling debris from one of 87 downed drones hit a residential building in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, the head of the region\u2019s military administration, Oleh Kiper, said. Debris also sparked a number of small fires, including at the city\u2019s port.Drone strikes and artillery fire also killed three people in Ukraine\u2019s Kherson, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, including a 73-year-old woman.In the western city of Lviv, Russian attacks severely damaged a museum dedicated to Roman Shukhevych, a controversial Ukrainian nationalist and military commander who fought for Ukrainian independence during World War II. University buildings in the town of Dubliany were also damaged, although no casualties were reported.Writing on social media, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi described the strike as \u201ca war for our history\u201d that was \u201csymbolic and cynical.\u201d Meanwhile, four people were killed and 13 more wounded following Ukrainian shelling on Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk, according to the region\u2019s Kremlin-installed leader, Denis Pushilin. Russian state media reported that a journalist was among the victims, but provided no further details.One person was also killed and another wounded in shelling on the Russian border town of Shebekino, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. ___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Of course, violence was always lurking with the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia and jihadist terrorism. These threats, however, could be easily dealt with \u2014 thanks to the support of the United States \u2014 without major budgetary difficulty. Across the continent, the resources dedicated to defense fell by almost a third compared with Cold War levels, to less than 2% of GDP almost everywhere.At the dawn of the new millennium, war had become something that only happened to others: Somalians, Afghans, Iraqis, Congolese, Syrians. Europeans were involved, or not, in these distant conflicts in which the victims numbered in the hundreds of thousands. By choice, not obligation.At the time, Europeans \u2014 the French especially \u2014 were gladly discussing common defense, battle groups and, more recently, strategic autonomy. To paraphrase the Abb\u00e9 de l\u2019Attaignant\u2019s poem, we were happy to talk about it \u2014 albeit less gracefully \u2014 without giving it substance. Not a single one of the battle groups created to much fanfare in 2006 ever saw the battlefield. Our coalition wars were generally led by the Americans or carried out within the NATO framework in the Persian Gulf, in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya, or against the Islamic State. Why should we step away from this platonic arrangement when the Americans were always there just in case? Moreover, just mentioning it was enough to raise the specter of an American withdrawal: this was evident in the horror of Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State under Clinton, when the Europeans voiced claims that, in her eyes, could lead to thorny overlaps of strategic functions and result in unacceptable discrimination to the detriment of the United States.At the dawn of the new millennium, war had become something that only happened to others.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgThis Europe of grand pronouncements and little result is the world of yesterday. It should have ended at the latest in 2014 following the invasion and annexation of Crimea, a power play that threw into question the very foundations of the European security order established after the Second World War. At the time, Russia was not in a position to militarily counter a Western reaction that went beyond economic sanctions, the limits of which we were well aware. Prompt and substantial military aid to Ukraine may have dissuaded Russia from further pressing its advantage. Additionally, although we could for a time believe in the longevity of good strategic weather, storm clouds were building as early as 2007 in the wake of Putin\u2019s revisionist speech in Munich. The more clear-sighted among us were troubled by this, but without any notable tangible effects.It would take the attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 for the changing era to fully emerge in all its brutality. The \u201ctrente paresseuses\u201d of the post-Cold War era were well and truly over.The war\u2019s three dimensionsThe clash of arms that erupted on February 24, 2022 naturally focused on the Ukrainian dimension of Europe\u2019s first war between states this century. As early as July 2021, President Putin had laid out his detailed vision of the \u201chistorical unity of Russians and Ukrainians\u201d, which he reiterated in a lengthy televised address on the eve of the invasion. In this manifesto there is no place for either a Ukrainian nation or state. It is this pursuit of ultimate war that continues to underpin the objectives of Russian operations: \u201cdenazification\u201d (the fall of the democratic Ukrainian government led by a broadly elected Russian-speaking Jew); demilitarization (no Ukrainian army); neutralization (no membership to either the European Union or NATO); recognition prior to any discussion of the annexation of one-fifth of Ukrainian territory (including, therefore, the as yet unconquered areas of the Kherson, Zaporijia and Donbass regions).On February 24, 2022, the \u201ctrente paresseuses\u201d of the post-Cold War era were well and truly over.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgA Russian victory on this basis, with the absorption and subjugation of a country like Ukraine, would in itself alter the strategic and military balance in Europe, not to mention the effects of the likely exodus of a large portion of Ukraine\u2019s 40 million inhabitants to the Union. The invasion and annexation of sovereign states would once again become the practice it used to be throughout Europe prior to 1945.Of course, even if victorious, Russia will at first emerge weakened by a war that will have caused massive losses, with up to 100,000 killed, and thousands of tanks. But, during the Crimean War (1853-1856), Napoleon III\u2019s France, with its modest population of 30 million, suffered comparable losses (95,000 dead). It nevertheless recovered quickly, delivering victory in Italy as soon as 1859, during which France annexed Savoy and the county of Nice. The same could be true of the vast country of Russia with its largely untouched oil and gas revenues, and its 140 million inhabitants which will also be able to recover.In Moscow\u2019s view, the war clearly goes beyond the Ukrainian objective. The clash of arms managed to overshadow President Putin\u2019s diplomatic statement of objectives for all of Europe in December 2021, ten weeks before the invasion began. At that time, Russian diplomacy presented the United States and NATO \u2014 but not the EU or its member states \u2014 with two so-called security treaties. These texts, presented as take-it-or-leave-it ultimatums, stipulated that NATO could not come to the aid of the 11 member states that had joined the organization after the collapse of the USSR in 1991; in other words, Europe would be set back thirty years in strategic terms. Moreover, no new states would be eligible to join the Atlantic Alliance; as a result, Finland and Sweden \u2014 among others \u2014 would lose their sovereignty in terms of security and defense policy. This Russian demand was unanimously opposed even before the start of the war. Statements made by the Russian and French presidents during their last meeting in Moscow on February 7, 2022, began with this subject, which dominated their discussions.These objectives have not been abandoned. If Russia is victorious in Ukraine, despite all the support provided by the West, it is sure to be back with a vengeance once the wounds of war have been healed in two or three years\u2019 time.Finally, and here too, events precede the start of the invasion, and Russia is bringing a global dimension to its undertaking. On February 4, 2022, coinciding with the Winter Olympics in Beijing, Presidents Xi and Putin made a joint declaration of \u201cno-limits friendship\u201d between their two countries. Although subsequent events have shown that there are indeed some limits to this friendship, this partnership is of great strategic and diplomatic importance: Russia provides China with considerable depth in terms of energy and agriculture, and China compensates for the shortcomings of the Russian economy. The two countries support each other at the UN and cooperate militarily in the Pacific \u2014 the world\u2019s most important zone in strategic and economic terms.In each of these dimensions, European interests are, to varying degrees, at stake. Like the Russians and, to a certain extent, Biden\u2019s United States, Europeans must operate in a more or less integrated way in these three dimensions.Good news, bad news, very bad newsFrom the very first hours, and for the first eighteen months of the war, there was a prevailing sense of surprise. Surprise, except in Moscow and Washington, that the invasion had even happened. But also surprise, except perhaps in Kiev, that the invasion was immediately met with fierce and effective resistance, while Moscow expected the Ukrainian government and its capital to fall within the first four days of the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. Such a rapid outcome would have rendered Western military support irrelevant. Finally, everyone, starting with the Europeans themselves, was surprised by the unity of Europe, particularly Germany, which proclaimed the Zeitenwende, the changing of an era: it gradually rose to become the leading European arms donor to Ukraine, with 7 billion euros planned in 2024. The key point here is that, in 2022, France lost the opportunity to lead Europe in the face of the Russian invasion: Emmanuel Macron had spent too much time in his vain attempt to win over a Putin impervious to the charms of \u201cat the same time\u201d (\u00aben m\u00eame temps\u00bb).From the very first hours, and for the first eighteen months of the war, there was a prevailing sense of surprise.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgIn fact, the Union immediately decided on and implemented major sanctions. These sanctions notably had the unexpected effect of virtually eliminating Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas. A European fund to finance military aid was set up, while European states played an active part in the \u201cRamstein Group\u201d, which brought together, under the leadership of the United States, some fifty countries around the world in support of the Ukrainian war effort. Over two years of war, European military aid \u2014 including from the United Kingdom and Norway \u2014 achieved parity with that provided by the United States, an unexpected result. Finally, Moscow was surprised that the Americans did not sacrifice their commitment in Ukraine on the altar of their strategic priority in the Indo-Pacific; on the contrary, the Biden administration saw a defeat in Ukraine as undermining the credibility of the United States in the face of China.", "source": "https://geopolitique.eu/en/2024/02/15/in-europe-ukraine-war-in-the-long-run/", "description": "Words Without Substance Over the course of the three decades that followed the end of the Cold War, Europeans were able to believe that their security faced no external existential threat.

Over the course of 2023, Ukraine managed to limit the initially devastating effects of Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure \u2014 particularly the electrical grid \u2014 and to break the Russian naval blockade of the Black Sea. This last point is crucial, given the Ukrainian economy\u2019s dependence on agri-food exports, and the importance of these exports to a number of countries in the South that import Ukrainian grain.Russia\u2019s powerful air force and Black Sea fleet faltered against a Ukraine whose navy is anecdotal and whose air force is numerically weak.Within twenty-two months, European military aid \u2014 including from the United Kingdom and Norway \u2014 achieved parity with that provided by the United States.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgOn the diplomatic front, and despite all the talk about the \u201cGlobal South\u201d, more than two-thirds of countries voted repeatedly against Russia at the UN General Assembly, while barely a quarter abstained and fewer than ten voted in support. These pleasant surprises concealed some less sunny realities, which are now coming to light. While Ukraine is resisting, it is not winning: more than one-sixth of its territory is currently occupied, fortified, annexed and being progressively Russified. In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s ground counter-offensive to sever the territorial continuity between Russia and Russian-occupied southern Ukraine failed. Successfully defending oneself, as the Ukrainians did in 2023, and recovering territory now deeply held by the invaders, are two different things. Although Russia\u2019s invasion plan certainly failed in its primary military objective, the invader managed to occupy the Ukrainian south within three days, from the edge of Mykola\u00efv to the outskirts of Mariupol.Despite its losses, Russia has learned not to disregard Ukrainian resistance and has adapted its tactics accordingly: effective mine and fortification warfare, successfully learning drone combat, and a certain superiority in terms of electronic warfare. Russia is also adding to its strengths, notably with the arrival of weapons from Iran and North Korea. Despite the Wagner militia\u2019s mutiny in June 2023 and Western sanctions, Putin\u2019s power shows no signs of economic, social or political collapse.The White House, which is often imitated by the Europeans, reacted slowly and hesitantly, even preventing the shipment of crucial military equipment to the battlefield, due to excessive fear of Russian reactions. It took sixteen months for the first Western heavy tanks to arrive. Twenty-three months after the start of the invasion, not a single Western-made combat aircraft had reached Ukraine. Neither the United States, except to a very limited extent, nor Germany, which has nearly 600 Taurus models, have delivered cruise missiles capable of striking the Russian military. Only the UK and France broke free of these restrictions by delivering Franco-British SCALP-Storm Shadow cruise missiles beginning in the summer of 2023; these missiles played a major role in the fight against the Russian fleet in the Black Sea and the Russian presence in Crimea, helping to break the blockade. Contrary to the fears expressed in Berlin and Washington, this did not lead to an unchecked escalation of the war. In the view of Germany and the United States, Ukraine should be able to restore its territorial integrity by withstanding the Russian assault, but without being able to respond deeply into the enemy\u2019s territory.Today, Ukraine is resisting, but not winning: more than one-sixth of its territory is currently occupied, fortified, annexed, and being progressively Russified.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgThe \u201ctrente paresseuses\u201d are being paid for today in Ukraine at a high cost. With the exception of South Korea vis-\u00e0-vis its terrifying neighbor to the north, no Western nation \u2014 not even the United States \u2014 has retained either the military-industrial capacity or the stockpiles of weapons and ammunition needed to rapidly wage a modern war between two major states. Washington had to source shells from South Korea and obtain ammunition from Japan for the Patriot missiles required for Ukraine\u2019s anti-missile defense.On the European side, things were no better; in the course of twenty-two months of war, the Union as a whole was able to deliver around 300,000 155 mm shells, enough for Ukraine to fight its war for twelve weeks. This was four times less than American shipments before they fell to zero in January 2024. France is now producing 2,000 \u201cfull rounds\u201d per month and plans to increase this to 3,000: enough to keep Ukraine at war for half a day, at the rate it has been waged for the first 20 months. However, Ukraine does not, or not yet, have the necessary factories on its soil to produce heavy artillery shells. The EU has now set a production target of 1.3 to 1.4 million shells a year by the end of 2024, a figure close to the US plan of 1.2 million by 2025. In the meantime, Ukraine currently needs more than 3.5 million shells per year, before the still uncertain promises made for 2025 are realized. Once the British and French reach their limits in terms of SCALP missile supply, and before their production possibly resumes, the Ukrainians will be left to face their losses alone, while Germany withholds its Taurus missiles, and the United States has parsimoniously supplied rare ATACMS missiles.The European Union as a whole was able to deliver around 300,000 155 mm shells, enough for Ukraine to fight its war for twelve weeks.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgThat\u2019s not the worst of it. We are now facing the prospect of American disengagement. This first manifested with the refusal of Congress to approve appropriations for the 2024 year. The immediate effect was the rationing of shells on the front line, with the daily consumption of shells falling from 8,000 to 2,000 in January. Today, four to five Russian heavy artillery shells are fired for every Ukrainian one. American anti-missile systems \u2014 Patriot, NASAM \u2014 are in short supply, with interception rates dropping from 80% to 40% against Russian cruise missiles, and to almost zero against hypersonic \u201cKinjal\u201d and other \u201cIskander\u201d missiles.This somewhat abstract accounting translates into very real destruction. Today, European defense resources are unable to make up for this shortfall: only one French-Italian \u201cMamba\u201d anti-missile system has been deployed in Ukraine.At the time of writing, the U.S. Congress, in the midst of its pre-election tug-of-war, has still not voted on appropriations for 2024. Congressional isolationism over the past few months has certainly been fueled by a polarized pre-election environment unlike anything seen since the years leading up to the Civil War. But it is by no means clear that this polarization will disappear, while American impatience with a Europe judged incapable of taking \u201cits\u201d war into its own hands is widely shared. This is also fueled by the only major issue which currently enjoys bipartisan political consensus in the United States, namely the desire to counter China\u2019s power. In view of the difficulties the United States is now having in fueling its war machine in the face of existing wars (Ukraine, Gaza) and potential wars (Taiwan), Europeans have been warned: the war in Ukraine will increasingly be their war.The European Union has so far managed to deal with its own financial problems. The 50 billion euro package initially planned for the years 2024-2027 was able to be approved despite Hungary\u2019s initial anti-Ukrainian veto. This aid is vital for preserving the stability of Ukrainian public finances, which underpins the Ukrainian war effort. For the moment, however, it has little impact on direct military aid, which remains largely a matter for individual countries.In the case of the USA and Europe, the confiscation of Russian central bank assets frozen in Western countries would solve the financial problem, with sums totaling around $300 billion. In practice, however, this would require the agreement of the G7 countries \u2014 Japan, the USA, Canada, France, Germany, the UK and Italy \u2014 as well as the EU itself. The advantage, but perhaps also the drawback, of this approach is that it avoids the need for agreement by the US Congress. It would be a technocratic solution to a political problem. This would set a major precedent and could weaken the international financial system. Even when tensions with Iraq and Iran were at their highest, funds frozen by foreign sanctions were not confiscated.Last but not least weighs the potential re-election of a Donald Trump who is running to win and preparing for his enthronement, whereas in 2016 he didn\u2019t think he would win and hadn\u2019t organized accordingly. He would be back in charge with both the will and the means to implement his anti-European, anti-NATO, Putin-aligned agenda. If his recent comments on settling Ukraine \u201cwithin 24 hours\u201d, or that Europe should not count too much on the United States, or his \u201cinvitation\u201d to Russia to attack countries in arrears on payments to Washington are anything to go by, Hurricane \u201cDonald\u201d would be swift, brutal and radical. At best, the United States would, like Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, become a dormant partner of NATO and at worst, a strategic partner with Russia, which it would try to pull away from its strategic partnership with China at the expense of concessions made at the expense of a scorned Europe.Even when tensions with Iraq and Iran were at their highest, funds frozen by foreign sanctions were not confiscated.Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg", "source": "https://geopolitique.eu/en/2024/02/15/in-europe-ukraine-war-in-the-long-run/", "description": "Words Without Substance Over the course of the three decades that followed the end of the Cold War, Europeans were able to believe that their security faced no external existential threat.

In 2019, at the Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on, in the presence of Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron called for bringing Europe and Russia closer together in order to liberate it from China\u2019s embrace. In 2020, he reiterated this grand vision at the Munich Security Conference, France having organized a strategic dialogue with Russia that was, by all accounts, completely sterile. If the French could have dreamt of such a reversal of alliances, why wouldn\u2019t a re-elected Trump, knowing that he would have even greater motives and far more means? Why not \u201cTrump in Moscow\u201d just as there was once \u201cNixon in Beijing\u201d?It is worth noting in passing that a scenario in which the United States descends into political and constitutional turmoil would be no less damaging. This could be the case if the election\u2019s outcome was not accepted by a large part of the electorate and institutions, including an increasingly controversial Supreme Court.Doing away with \u201cbonsai armies\u201dGiven these conditions, Europeans must follow a few fundamental principles in taking concrete steps for 2024 and beyond. First, the worst-case scenario is sufficiently likely to over-determine the actions we take. On one side, this includes Trump\u2019s victory, with the impacts mentioned above; on another, Putin\u2019s refusal to enter into negotiations that are in line with Ukraine\u2019s vital interests; and finally, Beijing\u2019s continued close China-Russian partnership with its Asian neighbors and the collective West. To this we could add the predicted rise in power of populist parties in the June 2024 European elections, though this does not mean a change in power within the EU Member States, which remain the main source of security and defense policy, directly and indirectly via the European Council.Should one or more of these scenarios prove false, the initiatives suggested here in the name of the worst-case scenario would still be valid: he who can do more, can do less.The worst-case scenario is sufficiently likely to over-determine the actions we take.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgAnother principle, already endorsed by Europeans but which is sometimes forgotten, is that Ukraine is the best judge of its interests and of the strategy devised to defend them. Our aid policy must therefore be determined accordingly. As stated by President Zelensky, this strategy involves the military isolation of Crimea, considered to be the war\u2019s center of gravity. Indeed, imposing such a threat to the control of Crimea is probably the best lever available to bring Russia to the negotiating table under conditions consistent with Ukraine\u2019s vital interests. The delivery of French and British cruise missiles is consistent with Kiev\u2019s choices. Conversely, failure to deliver German Taurus\u2019 or American equivalents is not.This principle assumes, however, that there is still strong coherence between Ukraine\u2019s war aims and those of its European partners. Territorial integrity, political sovereignty, security and defense guarantees, and eventual membership to the Union are currently shared objectives, as demonstrated by the fact that no European state has recognized Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, to cite an example sometimes presented as a source of disagreement. This does not mean, and Ukraine agrees, today as in 2014, that a cessation of hostilities is contingent on the prior and simultaneous success of these objectives. Just as in Germany during the Cold War and in Cyprus after it, situations of unconsented division and illegal occupation remain unresolved \u2014 provided, at least, that political and security aspects are guaranteed: West Germany joined NATO 45 years before reunification, and Cyprus joined the EU in 2004.In any case, our European allies must not forget that any outcome of the conflict which might be perceived and presented by Moscow as a defeat for Ukraine would have fundamental strategic consequences for the European Union and European members of NATO. This scenario, combined with the withdrawal of an increasingly disengaged America, makes the question of extending France\u2019s nuclear guarantee to its European allies an immediate one. The latter now have every reason to enter into the nuclear dialogue proposed by France, notably by President Macron in 2020, and again in Stockholm recently.There\u2019s another, empirical, principle to consider: the war of invasion will soon be entering its third year. All current and planned measures must be consistent with long-term warfare. This applies in particular to all aspects of our defense industry\u2019s organization. As a corollary to this principle, any immediate measures must be taken keeping in mind the medium-term outlook. For example, to help Ukraine improve its military situation, our countries will be able to draw more heavily on our national stocks of weapons and ammunition as soon as we decide to increase our production rates. This reasoning can also be used in reverse: the stronger and sooner Ukraine\u2019s military success, the less we\u2019ll have to draw on our stocks in the long term. However, the window of opportunity will close as soon as Russian forces are no longer \u201cpinned down\u201d in Ukraine.This last assertion cannot be proven, but like their Soviet predecessors, Russian leaders pay close attention to the analysis of the balance of power. The immediate effort is naturally to maintain European and national financial and military flows. This is all the more understandable given that, contrary to popular belief, \u201cwar fatigue\u201d is largely absent from European opinion: at the end of 2023, continuing the policy of aid to Ukraine remains supported by more than 50% of those surveyed in 18 of the 26 EU member states. In the other eight \u2014 Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Greece \u2014 where support falls short of the 50% mark, there are relative majorities, and often governments (Italy, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic in particular) that have clearly sided with Ukraine, supporting it militarily.The current and potential future failure of the United States also requires us to improve the quality of our efforts.It is also not impossible to leverage each individual nation\u2019s political influence. Do Germany\u2019s most motivated partners have as much influence as they could on the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles? Could France not convince Greece to agree to postpone the delivery of the SCALP missiles Athens has commissioned from us to benefit the Ukraine? After all, this is how Caesar cannons ordered by Denmark were able to be transferred to Ukraine.In the medium term, Europe \u2014\u00a0the Union and European NATO members alike\u00a0\u2014 must make the decisions required to face a Trumpian world. In budgetary terms, this means increasing the target of 2% of GDP allocated to defense by 2025, a decision made by NATO member countries following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Between now and 2030, this target should be 3%, a period of six years representing the equivalent of a military planning law, in line with industrial and organizational lead times. The annual budgetary effort at the EU level would be about 150 billion euros. If industry is up to the task, this would be enough to replace an end to American aid to Ukraine, and to begin the possible acquisition by European allies of so-called \u201ccornerstone\u201d military capabilities that the Americans could fully or partially withdraw from Europe: strategic intelligence capabilities, particularly space-based; anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense capabilities and the destruction of Russian anti-aircraft assets; command and control structures, etc.The sum may seem considerable, but Poland and Estonia have already increased their military budgets to 3% of GDP, as has Greece, which is facing Turkey. This was also the level of effort made by our partners during the Cold War, to say nothing of France, which was spending 5% to 6% of its GDP on the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d that was the Algerian War. For France, 3% is most likely the price it will have to pay to move the strategic autonomy it values from words to reality.Some have suggested that the Union could create a European defense fund, with Thierry Breton suggesting a total of 100 billion euros over a specified period. In Davos, Emmanuel Macron proposed that the Union issue bonds dedicated to defense. Why not? But any new European loan or corresponding increase in the Union\u2019s budget, established by treaty, is likely to be more difficult to sell politically than setting objectives that each nation meets in its own way \u2014 as was the case during the Cold War. What\u2019s more, the Union\u2019s financial framework would make it impossible to involve the UK, which, along with France, has the most experienced army and the widest range of skills among Europe\u2019s allies. This money, whether European or national, will only be successfully raised and spent if there is a major and difficult change in the way our armed forces acquire weapons and munitions. At present, each of our countries produces equipment on a very small scale: France has 220 Leclerc tanks and at one time exported just over 400, but does not have a tank production line. In the space of two years, Ukraine alone has destroyed or captured over 3,000 Russian tanks, more than 500 of which have been recycled in its own armed forces. The situation regarding shells has already been mentioned. In order to progress to large-scale production, it is not sufficient to urge manufacturers to produce by brandishing budget \u201cblueprints\u201d full of promises. Put another way, when it comes to armaments, we cannot go from small-scale to mass production by saying \u201cdo exactly what you did yesterday, but produce more\u201d.This transformation presupposes several non-financial initiatives in Europe, at both the national and EU levels, in areas that are within the purview of each decision-making level.", "source": "https://geopolitique.eu/en/2024/02/15/in-europe-ukraine-war-in-the-long-run/", "description": "Words Without Substance Over the course of the three decades that followed the end of the Cold War, Europeans were able to believe that their security faced no external existential threat.

The model here is the American Defense Production Act developed during the Korean War. It was this DPA that Trump deployed during the Covid pandemic, offering $22 billion to laboratories and manufacturers to develop the vaccine within a given timeframe. This resulted in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine just in time: the lives saved were worth far more than the 22 billion dollars spent. This is a challenge that Europeans at the Community level, as well as in each Member State, have every reason to tackle, particularly in a country like France, where the budgetary decision-making process has become extraordinarily cumbersome.In terms of armaments, we cannot easily go from small-scale to mass production.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgWe need to reconsider the responsibilities of Brussels, in particular with regard to the possibility of purchasing armaments for the Union as a whole, and those of national capitals, which remain largely sovereign in this matter. These acquisitions can be made either individually, as in the case of the French Rafale jet, or through multinational cooperation, as in the case of the Italian-German-Hispanic-British Eurofighter or, potentially, the Franco-Hispano-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS). Although these initiatives are necessary, they often span long periods, which limits their immediate relevance in light of the strategic earthquake threatening the United States.It would be better to concentrate on boosting the production of weapons and munitions that can be used on the battlefield before the end of the decade, including by deploying certain industrial resources in Ukraine itself, as Germany and France intend to do.Furthermore, it will be urgently necessary to adapt European, national, and even regional regulations \u2014 particularly at the level of the German L\u00e4nder \u2014 which impact the most environmentally sensitive industries to the needs of national defense: for example, the REACH directive for the chemical industry, or the Seveso regulations for all high-risk activities. This will be a difficult and delicate task, as each of these texts is legitimate in its own right. But there is some leeway between regulating an activity and making it impossible for a period of time that is in keeping with the urgency of national defense in the face of an invader. This is true for the industrial sector, such as ammunition production, but also in operational terms. When France wanted to move \u201cLeclerc\u201d armored vehicles to Romania using tank carriers at the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, national and local regulations prohibited any such transport, particularly in the part of Germany dominated by ecologists. In the end, the journey was made by train, at a reasonably slow pace. We were able to recover, as Russia had not attacked Romania in the meantime.Finally, there is the military version of what Brussels insiders call \u201ctaxonomy\u201d, an issue that has pitted Germany against France in the energy sector: Berlin initially wanted gas, which has a high carbon content, as well as renewable energies, to have better access to government and capital market financing than nuclear power, which is a zero-carbon energy source. In terms of defense, this means being relegated to the lowest tier, alongside alcohol and tobacco, particularly in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR); a poor CSR rating complicates access to financial markets. The example of Estonia underscores the seriousness of this decision: it had set out to build an artillery production line, hoping to benefit from a line of credit from a Swedish bank, but the bank refused, citing CSR. Furthermore, decisions are often private, not public as CSR is also imposed by the markets. This is a significant obstacle to the revitalization of Europe\u2019s defense industries. These are all small pieces of the past, inherited from the world of yesterday, and they risk jeopardizing the efforts needed for a future that is already here.Without sweeping and rapid changes in these areas, Europe will, for a long time to come, continue to build bonsai armies on a continent where Russia will be steadily pushing its pawns forward, while the United States will watch this defeat from its distant position in the Indo-Pacific region.It is important to remember, however, that Europe remains important to the United States in its tug-of-war with China. On the one hand, the EU is an indispensable market for Chinese trade and technology. Its single market enables it to impose its standards, including in new technologies. Americans and Europeans alike have begun to understand this, with the creation in 2021 of a Euro-American body to address investment and technology trade with China. On the other hand, in military terms, Europe remains an essential hub for American access to the Indian Ocean: at the risk of surprising, the continent and its military assets are closer to American bases in the Indian Ocean than the American West Coast is to Taiwan and the South China Sea. In other words, Europe has some leverage with which to influence American choices. All that remains is to convince Donald Trump, should he be re-elected. This was not the case during his first term.Here too, it is time to lay the groundwork: by Tuesday November 5th, it will already be too late.The Europeanization of NATO?What remains to be done is to define the political and institutional framework within which Europe can support Ukraine and replace an America that is less present.In the past, this debate was theological, and therefore unsolvable and theoretical, and therefore largely divorced from reality. Some, especially the French, prayed for a European defense that never materialized. Others, by far the majority, relied on the Americans via NATO, for good reasons \u2014 such as their credibility in the face of Russia \u2014 as well as bad ones. For example, many countries tended to want to pay as little as possible for their defense, relying on the goodwill of the American taxpayer.The war in Ukraine has shaken things up. The Russian threat has become a reality, and an American withdrawal is likely at a time when the European Union is playing an essential role, both in terms of military aid to Ukraine and the revival of the defense industry. Paradoxically, NATO is taking a back seat, as Western military aid is bilateral, or supported by the EU in the case of Europeans. Coordination is also taking place within the Ramstein Group, which brings together 53 countries that go far beyond the NATO framework.The trend is now twofold: the growing role of the European Union in defense matters on the one hand, and the Europeanization of NATO on the other. With or without the Americans, NATO performs functions, has an organizational culture and a structure that European institutions do not possess: command structures, standardization of equipment, and interoperability of forces at all levels are shared assets that do not need to be reinvented. Moreover, in Europe, NATO includes the United Kingdom and Norway. The same applies mutatis mutandis to the European Union, which alone has the industrial and regulatory powers without which Europe could not defend itself. In short, NATO knows how to wage war, with or without the United States, and Europe is learning how to plan defense over the long term.In other words, the time has come to face reality. The French and their partners must stop praying for a European defense that remains entirely theoretical.NATO knows how to wage war, with or without the United States, and Europe is learning how to plan defense over the long term.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgBut what should we call this emerging convergence between the Union and NATO? Some English-speaking analysts are already talking about \u201cEuro-NATO\u201d. It\u2019s a start, but it treats the Union as if it were a synonym, which is probably not a good idea. When it comes to defense and strategy, as elsewhere, misnaming things contributes to the world\u2019s ills. So, if we must move quickly to bring about this convergence, we should not be in too much of a hurry to name it.

What Happens if Support Collapses?American officials concede there is nothing on the horizon that could match the power of a new, $60 billion congressional appropriation to support its war against Russian aggression.Share full article881Graves and memorials in Lviv, Ukraine, last month. American officials say the symbolism of the United States pulling back now could be profound for the war in Ukraine.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesBy David E. SangerReporting from BerlinFeb. 7, 2024A year ago, when Washington and much of Europe were still awash in optimism that Ukraine was on the verge of repelling Russia from its territory, it seemed inconceivable that the United States would turn its back on the victim of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s aggression.Now, even as Senate Democrats try to salvage an aid package for Ukraine, that possibility remains real. And the political moment feels a long way from 14 months ago when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine stood before a joint session of Congress, wearing his signature drab green sweater, and basked in a minute-long standing ovation.The turnaround has surprised the White House. Even if the Senate manages to advance military aid, there are still plenty of reasons to doubt that the money will come through, including deep opposition among Republicans in the House and former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s push for a more isolationist stance.President Biden\u2019s aides insist they are not yet scrambling for other options.\u201cWe\u2019re not focused on Plan B,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, said in Brussels on Wednesday after a NATO meeting with his counterparts. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on plan A,\u201d which he said meant passing a bipartisan aid package that will enable Ukraine to \u201cdefend effectively and to take back territory that Russia currently occupies.\u201dImageCongress\u2019 threat to derail the aid comes just at the moment that Europe  committed $54 billion for rebuilding the country over the next four years. Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesBut behind the scenes there is a lot of discussion, in Washington and Europe, about other options, including seizing more than $300 billion in Russian central bank assets that are stashed in Western nations \u2014 a process that is turning out to be a lot more complicated than it first seemed.Still, American officials concede there is nothing on the horizon that could match the power of a new, $60 billion congressional appropriation, which would buy bolstered air defenses, more tanks and missiles, and a huge influx of ammunition.And, they add, the symbolism of America pulling back now could be profound.European officials who have been dreading the possibility that Mr. Trump might be re-elected and make good on his promise to withdraw from NATO are beginning to wonder, at least in private, about the reliability of the United States, no matter who is president.If Republicans are willing to abide by Mr. Trump\u2019s demand that they vote against continued aid to Ukraine, one senior European diplomat in Berlin asked on Wednesday, why would Europe rely on Mr. Biden\u2019s assurance that the United States would \u201cdefend every inch\u201d of NATO territory? Even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security aides \u2014 the ones he long ago split with \u2014 are beginning to say that a failure to fund Ukraine would amount to a huge strategic win for Mr. Putin.\u201cThe United States has a clear choice: arm the Ukrainians with the weapons they need to defend themselves or cut off aid and abandon democratic Ukraine in its struggle for national survival against Putin\u2019s aggression,\u201d H.R. McMaster, who served for a year as the second of Mr. Trump\u2019s four national security advisers, said on Monday. He noted that while Congress debated, \u201cthe abandonment of Kyiv would be a gift to the Moscow-Tehran-Beijing-Pyongyang axis of aggressors. Allies and partners would lose trust in America as those aggressors are emboldened.\u201dOddly enough, Congress\u2019s threat to derail the aid comes just at the moment that Europe committed $54 billion for rebuilding the country over the next four years, and countries from Norway to Germany are committing new arms aid. \u201cIt is remarkable how quickly Europe has moved toward a new and substantive multiyear support program for Ukraine,\u201d said Christoph Trebesch, who directs the production of the Ukraine Support Tracker at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in northern Germany. \u201cFor the first time, the U.S. is now lagging behind by a large margin\u201d compared with European aid, he said.ImageIf the United States pulls the plug on its support for the war, much of the day-to-day military necessities will go away.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times\u201cThis is not charity; it is in our own security interest,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said at the alliance\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday, appearing at a news conference with Mr. Sullivan. A Russian victory, he added, \u201cmatters for European security and it matters for American security.\u201dBut this argument, that the West must push back on Russia in Ukraine or face the possibility of fighting it on NATO territory, seems to be losing its effectiveness in Congress. And some Republican members of Congress are still accusing Europe of not pulling its weight, even if the newest financial commitments change the equation.But none of these arguments, officials in the U.S. and Europe say, can overcome the reality: If the United States pulls the plug on its financial support for the war, much of the day-to-day military necessities will go away \u2014 starting with air defense against the near-daily barrages of missiles, drones and other weaponry aimed at urban centers and critical infrastructure like the electric grid. And if the country\u2019s economy collapses, it will terminate a two-year-long effort to save a fledgling if deeply flawed democracy.The Republicans opposing the aid don\u2019t argue directly with that logic, though many insist that pouring billions into a country with a deep history of corruption invites misuse. Instead, their primary argument is that the money should be spent at home, on the southern border rather than Ukraine\u2019s borderlands with Russia. The most outspoken of the opponents, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, contend that Ukraine aid \u201cputs America last.\u201dFor months, the White House saw them as a fringe group. But polling shows that the percentage of Republican voters who say the United States has spent too much defending the country is soaring. And now many Republicans have grown resistant, aligning their own views with the long-held position espoused by Mr. Trump, who in the 2016 campaign said he did not want to defend Ukraine. Eight years later he is insisting \u2014 without offering any details \u2014 that he would end the war in 24 hours.ImageAs the war enters its third year, Ukrainians are facing more difficulty in the conflict.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesNow the opposition has so taken hold that even the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has declared time and again that funding the war in Ukraine was one of his top priorities, seemed to be backpedaling.Meanwhile, Mr. Biden\u2019s aides are trying to figure out how to pay for weapons if Congress remains paralyzed. The plan to seize Russian assets has complications. It\u2019s not clear that the reserves could be used to pay for air defense and artillery. Even that, administration officials say, could require congressional action \u2014 though presumably there are more votes in the House and Senate for spending Russia\u2019s money than spending the United States\u2019.There is also discussion of conducting complex weapons swaps, similar to what Japan and South Korea have done, where they have provided their artillery shells to the United States, freeing up Washington to give more to Ukraine. (Both countries have said they could not export directly to a war zone.) Or, perhaps, have European nations pay for American weapons and ship those to Ukraine.But Europe clearly doesn\u2019t have the capacity to provide much more ammunition by itself. During the 30 years of increasingly uneasy peace with Russia, Europe dismantled much of its production capability. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in a recent speech that \u201cwe will have delivered over half a million rounds of artillery shells by next month\u201d and \u201cmore than one million by the end of the year,\u201d but she acknowledged that \u201cthis is certainly not enough.\u201dEurope also has little to contribute to drone manufacturing. And Germany remains unwilling to turn over its most powerful long-range, air-launched cruise missile, the Taurus, for fear it will be used deep inside Russian territory. Germany\u2019s role is bound to be at the center of a meeting between Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Mr. Biden at the White House on Friday.Mr. Sullivan, for his part, insists that if the administration sticks to its strategy, it will prevail. \u201cWalking away from Ukraine at this moment, at this time, would be fundamentally wrong from the point of view of our basic national security in the United States and for our NATO allies, as well,\u2019\u2019 he said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd we think we will continue to win that argument.\u201dSteven Erlanger contributed reporting from Oslo.David E.

Both sides need time to replenish their resources, which have been depleted by the two years of war. Russia has redirected its already battered economy towards the defence industry and is steadily rebuilding its stockpiles, though not to the extent and capability suggested by the official channels. Nevertheless, in 2024, Russia holds the advantage over Ukraine in terms of military capability.In the west, we must work to create the necessary conditions to ensure that Kyiv can prevail on the battlefield at least in 2025. The Estonian Ministry of Defence has proposed a suitable long-term strategy that would, for instance, require each Ramstein coalition country to contribute 0.25% of GDP to military assistance to Ukraine. If countries follow this plan in a synchronised manner rather than sporadically, a military victory for Ukraine on its own territory becomes achievable.Beyond the BattlefieldHowever, ending the war is not solely a matter of what happens on the battlefield. The decision to end the war must be made by either the attacking party by stating that its objectives have been achieved or the losing party by surrendering. Ukraine cannot surrender because this is an existential war for it. I shudder to think of the consequences for Ukraine if the occupiers were to seize power. The aggressor has already provided some glimpses into its plans in places like Bucha, Izyum, and Kherson.At the same time, Putin has repeatedly stated that neither have Russia\u2019s objectives in Ukraine changed nor been accomplished. One of those objectives was to topple the legitimate government in Kyiv. We should not assume that merely capturing or losing territory would change the aggressor\u2019s intentions. But Ukraine\u2019s victory on the battlefield is certainly a prerequisite for the Kremlin to even consider other options.Any expectation of a spontaneous purging of the Putin regime and declaration of an end to the war overnight is unrealistic. Similarly, the regime voluntarily handing itself over to a tribunal is improbable. A voluntary regime change is possible but highly unlikely. Even if it were to happen, the old regime would negotiate immunity for its crimes. This was evident in the last real change of power in Russia when Putin secured his predecessor\u2019s immunity through a decree, as Yeltsin\u2019s main concern at that time was domestic corruption investigations.Another option is that the old regime is deposed, and its members face trial. Currently, this scenario is also improbable. When considering the two scenarios together, history indicates that the latter is more likely to occur yet would still require significant societal dissatisfaction. The latest examples include Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s departure from power in 2000 and the removal of Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. It must be noted, however, that the level of suppression in Russian society today is much greater than what Serbia or Ukraine were experiencing at the time.Harnessing Intelligence DataSanctions are essential to influence Russia\u2019s leadership and strangle its war machine. Existing sanctions must be rigorously enforced to prevent any loopholes. The Russian elite with close ties to the current regime must be completely deprived of the ability to live a comfortable and affluent life in the west. Assets held by shell companies and nominees must be frozen or confiscated.How can this be achieved? It is crucial to bear in mind that any reputable western intelligence agency probably should know about any individuals who reside within their jurisdiction and are linked to the current Russian leadership under surveillance, and especially about their interactions with their home country.It is reasonable to discuss whether and how the assets of the aggressor\u2019s elite could be confiscated in a simplified manner. Typically, intelligence is not gathered with the intention of using it in court. Its purpose is to create situational awareness and complement informed decision-making in national defence. However, the current circumstances provide an opportune moment to consider whether information collected by the various intelligence disciplines could be justifiably used as grounds for freezing or confiscating Russian assets.We live in an era where it is possible to eliminate terrorists in almost any corner of the world based on intelligence information. Therefore, we should at least be open to discussing how intelligence data could be employed in mapping Russian assets and temporarily freezing them pending a court investigation. As of now, European countries have varying approaches to the extent and impact of using intelligence information in legal proceedings.The Importance of the Defence IndustryUkraine\u2019s domestic drone and missile industry needs additional support because it represents the only means through which Ukraine can exert influence on Russian territory, which brings awareness of the war to Russian society. If these attacks can only be carried out with Ukrainian-made weapons, countries that fear escalation when a NATO member\u2019s weapons are used to attack Russian territory can maintain their stance.The Russian leadership, no matter how autocratic, still depends on the opinions and attitudes of its people. Living under constant fear of missile attacks and experiencing even a fraction of the horrors endured by Ukrainian people may eventually change public opinion and support for the war in Russian society where support for the war is still prevalent. Even the organisations representing the mothers and wives of Russian soldiers are not campaigning against the war; instead, they are advocating for the swift return of their loved ones from the front lines.However, relying solely on the Ukrainian domestic industry will not suffice for a military triumph. Western support must be sustained at a level that enables Ukraine to defeat Russia on the battlefield. There is a significant shortage of air defence systems and ammunition. Moreover, air defence is primarily a defensive capability and, as such, is critical to protect the civilian population from the aggressor\u2019s crimes. To launch a new offensive, however, it is essential to achieve superiority in indirect fire capabilities. Thus, a substantial influx of artillery ammunition and systems is required.Additionally, Kyiv needs more long-range impact weapon systems to influence Russian assembly areas and disrupt the enemy\u2019s logistics and the work of command posts. And, of course, the Ukrainian troops constantly rely on more equipment, supplies, and trained personnel to sustain their effort. There is no single weapon system or type of ammunition that can magically solve Ukraine\u2019s problems. Ukraine is engaged in full-scale conventional warfare, where cooperation between all branches of the military and various weapon systems is necessary for success. The axiom holds true: quantity has a quality all its own.The reality is grim \u2013 Western reserves are running low, and the new production capacities are not yet sufficient. Many promises made in 2022 and 2023 to multiply ammunition production will only materialise by the end of this or next year. Public calls by politicians to boost industrial production are encouraging but often remain empty slogans because companies are awaiting orders, not just motivational speeches. Estonian proposal for the procurement of up to a million artillery shells in the EU collectively was relevant one year ago. But after failing to deliver it on (the promised) schedule, Europe should strive to be more ambitious. In Ukraine\u2019s Defence Minister Rustem Umarov\u2019s estimates, Moscow\u2019s artillery usage is up to 6\u00a0000 shells daily, whereas Kyiv is able to respond with only around a third of that amount. The demand will skyrocket if an offensive \u2014 by either side \u2014 starts. Meanwhile, Ukraine effectively needs close to 3 million artillery shells per year.The defence industry requires assurance that if a company invests in new facilities and personnel, it will recoup its investment. The reluctance of Western governments to commit to long-term agreements with the defence industry is perplexing. In the meantime, national stockpiles are already depleting, many countries are increasing their defence budgets (and thus procurement spending), and supporting Ukraine will undoubtedly remain on the agenda for at least the next three to four years.The Russian Threat PersistsParadoxically, the Russian threat will not dissipate regardless of whether it suffers defeat or triumphs in Ukraine.Under the first scenario, there might be substantial pressure on the Kremlin to embark on a victorious venture elsewhere. In the second case, the regime might perceive itself as invincible and be tempted to repeat its victory in another campaign \u201cagainst NATO.\u201d Hence, if we aim for Ukraine\u2019s success on the battlefield and wish to foster internal changes in Russia, western nations must sustain their long-term preparedness. Ultimately, we are defending ourselves.This article was written for\u00a0ICDS Diplomaatia magazine.

The war follows on Russian territorial aggression against its neighbor that began in 2014 with the illegal annexation of Crimea and a proxy war in the eastern Donbas region.Tracking developments in the Ukraine war, the Brookings Institution \u2014 in partnership with The Washington Post \u2014 presents the Ukraine Index, which compiles security, economic, and political data presented in graphic form. Our purpose is to provide updated information on such key metrics as changes in the control of Ukrainian territory by the two sides, the amount of support for Ukraine from the U.S. and Europe as well the political support for continued aid, and the health of the Ukrainian economy. Our Ukraine Index is intended to contribute to our understanding of this conflict, and thereby to a more informed public debate.We will update the index regularly and expand or amend the featured data as circumstances change. The data itself is taken from a variety of sources (government, international organizations, private). Since tracking data from the Ukraine war has been under dangerous circumstances in a war zone, it is of necessity approximative or incomplete.SecurityThe war in Ukraine, now in its second year, remains an unpredictable conflict, yet the Ukrainian people\u2019s unwavering bravery and resilience continue to inspire. Key battlefield trends \u2014 such as territorial control, drones and cruise missiles interceptions, and U.S. security assistance \u2014 reveal the ongoing dynamics of the conflict.

FORCES ARM\u00e9ES UKRAINIENNES VIA AFP   The change of stance is official. Three months after the failure of its counter-offensive launched with great hope in June 2023 but which broke down on Russian fortifications along the front line, Ukraine has resolved to lower its ambitions. \"We have moved from offensive action to a defensive operation,\" said the new commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, in a short interview broadcast on February 13 by the German channel ZDF, almost two years after the launch of Moscow's \"special military operation.\" The Ukrainian army has little choice. The density of Russian minefields \u2013 up to five explosive devices per square meter, up to 15 to 20 kilometers wide \u2013 has made a mechanized breakthrough illusory, at least with the breaching equipment currently available to Kyiv. Similarly, the thousands of observation drones that fly over the front line every day have, according to the military, made the battlefield \"transparent,\" preventing any concentration of forces. As soon as vehicles or troops are grouped together, they are targeted by artillery or hunted down by explosive drones.  Read more Subscribers only Why Ukraine's counter-offensive is failing    'Digging for protection' Above all, Kyiv's army is facing a serious ammunition crisis. In the absence of an agreement in the United States Congress between Democrats and Republicans, the US has not delivered shells and rockets to Ukraine since the beginning of the year, and Europeans are still struggling to revive their arms factories. To make up for their lack of artillery, Kyiv's army does make extensive use of so-called \"FPV\" (First Person View) drones, which are remotely piloted with immersive goggles and are therefore highly accurate, but they are not enough to make up the difference with Russia. According to analysts, the \"fire ratio,\" which measures the difference in the volume of artillery fire between two belligerents, is now one to 10, or even 12, in Russia's favor. \"The Ukrainians can't hold out with such a ratio without losing a lot of men. It's more reasonable for them to fall back on defensive positions that are valued,\" said St\u00e9phane Audrand, international risk consultant and reserve officer.  Read more Subscribers only White House warns Republicans that Ukraine faces diminishing funds    This \"upgrading\" of defenses \u2013 the military term for fortifying lines with trenches, prefabricated bunkers, mines and anti-tank devices \u2013 is something the Ukrainians have been working on since the start of the winter, at breakneck speed in the face of Russian pressure. In the east of the country, in the Donetsk oblast, they are building a network of forts protecting each other. Further north, in the Kharkiv oblast, and south in the Zaporizhzhia region, at least two lines of defense are being built around urban centers and strategic axes. \"Digging for protection is a constant feature of warfare. The Ukrainian conflict is no exception, despite all the technology deployed,\" said a French military source. You have 72.16% of this article left to read.

Confident initial predictions of a swift Russian triumph were repeatedly proven wrong. Instead, Russia\u2019s military was beset by poor logistics, corruption, a sclerotic command structure and an inability to counter Ukrainian tactics. Kyiv\u2019s armed forces successfully prevented a rash Russian attempt to seize the Ukrainian capital and then stopped the entire Russian advance. After six months, they began turning the Russian invaders back, recapturing swathes of territory around Kharkov in the north and Kherson in the south. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was feted by Western leaders, parlaying his personal popularity into commitments of military aid and insisting Ukraine could prevail with a more sophisticated arsenal.Yet for all these early successes, the war soon devolved into repeated human waves of attacks by Russian conscripts against well-defended Ukrainian positions. The slow drip-feed of Western weapons forced Kyiv to significantly delay its 2023 counteroffensive. This gave Russia\u2019s armed forces time to design deep and elaborate defensive fortifications, minefields and tank traps.

Nearly a year later, Russian forces captured the town.Libkos/APIndeed, thanks largely to Russian efforts, Ukraine is now the most heavily mined country in the world.Once Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive commenced, its forces made little headway and took heavy losses, especially given the lack of air support. Facing personnel and equipment shortages, Zelensky dramatically fired his military chief, Valerii Zaluzhny, earlier this month, opting for a new strategy that seeks to build Ukrainian strength while blocking further Russian advances.Russia: weakened, but determinedAfter being humiliated by failing to immediately achieve the objectives of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in early 2022, the Kremlin attempted to cow an obstinately united West through bluff and bluster, while bludgeoning Ukrainian cities and military positions. It repeatedly rattled nuclear sabres, mobilised isolationist and far-right groups throughout Europe and warned of a looming world war. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rhetoric bordered on unhinged, punctuated by rants about the moral decrepitude of \u201cSatanic\u201d Western culture that only Russian traditional values could resist. Tellingly, in a rare moment of honesty, Putin also admitted the obvious: invading Ukraine was about restoring what he saw as Russia\u2019s \u201chistoric lands\u201d. While mobilising hundreds of thousands of men for sacrifice in the Ukrainian meat-grinder, the Kremlin sought to project an image of a society overseen by a stable, albeit xenophobic troika. Putin was the wise tsar, the Orthodox Church was the steward of Russia\u2019s conservative soul and the military served as Russia\u2019s armoured bulwark.

But this failed to mask the reality that Russia itself was increasingly becoming Nazified, as its hyper-nationalist \u201cZ\u201d movement made clear. So, too, did repeated genocidal and antisemitic language: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u2019s crude observation that both Adolf Hitler and Zelensky had Jewish bloodcomparisons between Ukrainians and vermin and overt calls by Kremlin-sponsored propagandists for a \u201csolution of the Ukrainian question\u201d.Simultaneously, Russia\u2019s draconian crackdown on internal dissent resulted in lengthy jail terms for anyone found guilty of criticising the war or army.Russian police detain an anti-war protester against in St.Petersburg in the early days of the conflict.Anatoly Maltsev/EPARussia\u2019s failures also brought the audacious revolt in June 2023 by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, and one of Putin\u2019s closest confidantes. And despite Prigozhin\u2019s subsequently convenient death, the fact he had managed to march largely unchallenged through Russia until voluntarily stopping 200 kilometres from Moscow made Putin look considerably weakened.However, with the start of 2024, Russia\u2019s forces have started pressing again on the battlefield, making small territorial gains.A recent report puts the current number of Russian military personnel in Ukraine at 470,000. And although it is believed to have lost a staggering 8,800 armoured fighting vehicles and some 315,000 dead and wounded \u2013 fully 90% of the forces it began the war with \u2013 the Russian armed forces have finally begun to adapt.

Join us.\u2018Anatoly Maltsev/EPAWhat will the coming year bring?How the war unfolds in 2024 will have momentous implications for the world \u2013 a fact not receiving near enough attention in Western media coverage.It will determine whether Ukraine is able to retain its territory and begin the painful rebuilding process. It will be decisive for Putin\u2019s wager that conquest comes without consequences, perhaps emboldening him to sets his sights on other states on its periphery.  It will confirm whether Europe can remain stabilised, secure and united, and whether America will continue to be seen as a reliable ally.For the Kremlin, the key question is whether it can keep domestic discontent muted long enough for the West to lose interest in the war and withdraw its support for Ukraine. It is unlikely to run out of weapons, having massively ramped up domestic production of armaments and sourcing drones and ammunition from a rogues\u2019 gallery of pariahs: Iran and North Korea. Ukraine, which is fighting for national survival, faces a tougher and grimmer 2024. It will need to continue absorbing relentless Russian attacks, keep its economy afloat and rebuild its military strength for yet another attempt to evict Russia\u2019s forces.Zelensky\u2019s famous \u201cI need ammunition, not a ride\u201d response to a US offer to evacuate him in 2022 holds just as true two years later. Without a constant stream of military aid, Ukrainian resistance will be very hard to sustain.

This is causing ammunition shortages that are already being measured in Ukrainian lives and territory. But a far greater threat lies on the horizon, in the real prospect of a second Donald Trump presidency. Putin is well aware Trump will give him a free hand in Ukraine and probably beyond it, too. Accordingly, he is investing significant efforts to back his candidacy. The extraordinary spectacle of Putin \u2013 the leader of a hostile foreign power \u2013 using an \u201cinterview\u201d with ex-Fox News personality Tucker Carlson to rally the Trump base was a keen indicator of that.Europe is finally beginning to wake up to the reality a Trump-led US could abandon NATO, in addition to Ukraine. But whether European nations are able to overcome their institutional inertia and webs of entangled interests to stoutly resist Russia on their own remains an open question.It\u2019s an old adage, but wars are world-shaping. Their outcomes are far-reaching: redrawing maps, establishing new fault lines, and ushering in the birth and death of nations. Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is proving to be no different.
