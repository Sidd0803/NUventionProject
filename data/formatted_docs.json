The EU and US are contemplating new sanctions against Russia, partly in response to continuing warfare, partly as a reaction to the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Russia has taken the Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, apparently suffering tremendous military losses while doing so, and Canada has agreed to expand Ukraine\u2019s drone warfare capabilities. Rocket and air strikes continue to kill civilians.We first published this reading list on March 1, 2022. Since then,we\u2019ve been updating it on a regular basis.

Hooker, Kimberly Talley, and Anca Agachi, \u201cA SECURITY STRATEGY FOR THE BLACK SEA,\u201d Atlantic Council, published December 1, 2023.An unstable Black Sea region directly threatens the peace and prosperity of the North Atlantic community, a bedrock of US foreign policy since 1945. Russian aggression in the Black Sea region threatens the security of every Black Sea state and the Euro-Atlantic region as a whole, as well as global food security, international economic stability, and the viability of international legal frameworks. These represent key and important interests for the United States, as well as Europe.Lo\u00efc Simonet, \u201cTrends in International Politics 2024: From \u2018as Long as It Takes\u2019 to \u2018as Long as We Can\u2019: Will the West Abandon Ukraine?\u201d OIIP \u2013 Austrian Institute for International Affairs, published January 1, 2024.On 8 June 2023, in a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, U.S. President Joe Biden said he believes the United States has the funds to \u201csupport Ukraine as long as it takes\u201d (The White House, 2023 a). Six months later, at his joint press conference with V. Zelensky, Biden\u2019s tone had a worrying nuance: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to supply Ukraine with critical weapons and equipment as long as we can\u201d (White House, 2023 b). The fact is that, in the meantime, aid for Ukraine has become a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain.Emma Schroeder and Sean Dack, \u201cA PARALLEL TERRAIN: Public-Private Defense of the Ukrainian Information Environment,\u201d Atlantic Council, published January 1, 2024.Russian assaults on the Ukrainian information environment are conducted against, and through, largely privately owned infrastructure, and Ukrainian defense in this space is likewise bound up in cooperative efforts with those infrastructure owners and other technology companies providing aid and assistance. The role of private companies in this conflict seems likely to grow, along with the scale, complexity, and criticality of the information infrastructure they operate. Examining and mitigating the risks related to the involvement of private technology companies in the war in Ukraine is crucial and looking forward, the United States government must also examine the same questions with regard to its own security and defense.Daniel Shapiro, \u201cYear Two of the Invasion: Where Do Former Soviet Countries Stand?\u201d European Leadership Network, published June 2023.Ukraine\u2019s most novel contribution to the field of anti-corruption, however, has been its extensive public disclosures of who owns what throughout the political-economic system. Reformers were tired of corruption investigations running into dead ends in the form of anonymously owned companies, fancy cars and properties with unknown owners, secret information about public procurements, and politicians who lied about their wealth and income.Georgy Poroskoun and Yaron Gamburg, \u201cChanging Israel\u2019s Policy on Russia and Ukraine,\u201d Institute for National Security Studies, published January 3, 2024.Common understandings of the Wagner Group tend to over-emphasize its military strength or focus on the ineffectiveness of its mercenary troops. Instead, this report illustrates how its military capacity and operations vary significantly across different conflict theaters.Emily Winterbotham, \u201cThe Impact of Gendered Narratives in the Conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Global Center on Cooperative Security, published August 2023.Traditional gendered narratives have often been resurrected by all sides to the Ukraine conflict, with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s appeal to women, mothers, sisters, and fianc\u00e9es to support their loved ones in battle; the image beamed around the world of a wounded, pregnant Ukrainian woman curled on a stretcher; and comments made by the UK defense secretary that President Putin is suffering from \u201csmall man syndrome\u201d providing just some examples.Gustav Gressel, \u201cBEYOND THE COUNTER-OFFENSIVE: ATTRITION, STALEMATE, AND THE FUTURE OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE,\u201d European Council on Foreign Relations, published January 1, 2024.The Russian war against Ukraine has become a war of attrition. Such a conflict will impose enormous costs on both sides, but over time it will favour Russia. The Russian defence-industrial base cannot compensate for Russia\u02bcs current loss rates, but it can replace its equipment faster than the West is, as of now, willing to do for Ukraine. For the time being at least, a war of attrition implies a Russian victory.This outcome is far from inevitable. But Ukraine cannot overcome Russia in a war of attrition without stepped-up Western assistance.Danish Institute for International Studies, \u201cENERGY AS A WEAPON: DECODING BLACKMAIL TACTICS IN EUROPE,\u201d Danish Institute for International Studies, published January 2024.\u201cEnergy blackmail\u201d became a buzzword following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent energy crisis, but the phenomenon is not new. Energy blackmail has been employed by states to leverage their strategic energy resources for decades. In Europe, the weaponisation of energy predates Vladimir Putin\u2019s time in Kremlin. Despite EU efforts to diversify its energy supply, the threat of energy blackmail persists, posing challenges not only to traditional energy dependencies but also to the increasingly digitalised energy sector.Alicja Bachulska and Mark Leonard, \u201cChina and Ukraine: The Chinese Debate about Russia\u2019s War and Its Meaning for the World,\u201d European Council on Foreign Relations, published July 2023.This policy brief sets out to understand the ways in which China\u02bcs political and intellectual elites see the war in Ukraine. It draws four key lessons from more than 30 off-the-record interviews undertaken by the authors with Chinese thinkers and strategists in top universities, think-tanks, and party-affiliated organs, and from the study of articles and debates in the Chinese foreign policy community. Their views are complemented by an analysis of official Chinese documents and an extensive literature review of academic journals and media accounts relating to the war in Ukraine.Dick Zandee and Ad\u00e1ja Stoetman, \u201cThe War in Ukraine: Adapting the EU\u2019s Security and Defence Policy,\u201d Clingendael Institute, published July 2023.Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is violating the rules-based international order and poses a significant threat to European security. The EU and NATO have responded by taking coordinated action. The measures taken have varied from unprecedented sanctions on Russia to assisting Ukraine with the delivery of arms and ammunition. The war in Ukraine has led to an even stronger focus on collective defence, which was already put in motion after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Furthermore, the European security architecture has witnessed a significant change with Finland (and later this year Sweden) joining the North Atlantic Alliance. At the Vilnius Summit (11-12 July 2023), NATO has taken new decisions to strengthen its deterrence and defence posture.Clara Portela, \u201cThe EU and the Transformed Nuclear Context since the War in Ukraine,\u201d Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI), published May 11, 2023.But it was, above all, the more or less explicit threats of nuclear-weapons use issued repeatedly throughout 2022 by Russia\u2019s leaders\u2014notably President Vladimir Putin himself\u2014that commanded the most attention from media and policy circles. No less than 165 \u201cinteractions with a nuclear dimension\u201d were observed in the course of barely one year. What impact are such actions having on European security?Michal Smetana, \u201cDo Europeans (Still) Support Arms Control Talks with Russia?\u201d Peace Research Center Prague, published November 2023. Would the European public support new arms control negotiations with Moscow in the current international security environment? Recent evidence suggests that despite Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and generally hostile foreign policy directed toward the collective West, engaging Russia in arms control talks would be met with broad societal approval.Max Bergmann, What Could Come Next?: Assessing the Putin Regime\u2019s Stability and Western Policy Options, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), published January 2023.The potential for Ukrainian military success to cause regime instability in Moscow has generated understandable nervousness among many Western governments about what could follow Putin. In fact, there is a growing assumption that what follows his reign could very well be worse. Such a pessimistic outlook might seem sober\u2014but, as this issue brief argues, it could very well be wrong.Samuel Charap and Miranda Priebe, Avoiding a Long War: U.S. Policy and the Trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, RAND Corporation, published January 2023.The trajectory and ultimate outcome of the war will, of course, be determined largely by the policies of Ukraine and Russia. But Kyiv and Moscow are not the only capitals with a stake in what happens. This war is the most significant interstate conflict in decades, and its evolution will have major consequences for the United States. It is appropriate to assess how this conflict may evolve, what alternative trajectories might mean for U.S. interests, and what Washington can do to promote a trajectory that best serves U.S. interests.Davis Ellison, \u201cDangerous Waters: Contextualising Maritime Technological Trends for the Post-Ukraine War World,\u201d in Maritime Security in a Time of Renewed Interstate Competition: Navigating the Royal Netherlands Navy through the Geopolitical and Technological Challenges and Threats in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Regions, Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, published January 2024.In the second month of Russia\u2019s invasion, the Black Sea flagship Moskva was sunk after being struck by two Ukrainian-made R-360 \u2018Neptune\u2019 anti-ship missiles. The Moskva was the largest warship to be sunk in combat since the Falklands War. The naval aspect of this war has included, among other elements, the large use of missiles and combined use of airborne and maritime drones to harass naval assets both at sea and in port. 38 Altogether, the experience of the Russian Black Sea fleet has been a dangerous one, likely in ways that were not anticipated in Moscow or in many other capitals.These battlefield developments imply a possible shift in maritime technology away from large, vulnerable surface platforms and towards an emphasis on a massive amount of data collected by many sensors that can constantly feed information to a wide array of strike assets.Max Bergmann, Tina Dolbaia, and Nick Fenton. Russia\u2019s Adaptation Game: Deciphering the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cHumanitarian Policy,\u201d Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), published December 2022.At first glance, the new policy, coming six months after Moscow\u2019s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, seems detached from reality. It describes the Russian Federation as a country that aspires to maintain in the world. \u201cThis has absolutely nothing to do with the reality\u2014the catastrophe into which Russia is plunging itself,\u201d Elena Sorokina, a journalist with the Russian-language multinational and multireligious peace and stability notes branch of Radio Liberty.Jon Bateman, How Militarily Effective Have Russia\u2019s Cyber Operations Been in Ukraine? Russia\u2019s Wartime Cyber Operations in Ukraine: Military Impacts, Influences, and Implications. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, published December 2022.The dissenting camp describes Russian cyber operations as sweeping in scale, tactically effective in key moments, and aligned with Moscow\u2019s military objectives of disrupting, confusing, and cowing the Ukrainian government, armed forces, and civilian population.Andrea Kendall-Taylor, Michael Kofman, Nicholas Lokker, and Heli Hautala, \u201cAssessing the Evolving Russian Nuclear Threat,\u201d Center for a New American Security, published October 1, 2023.From what we know from Putin\u2019s speeches\u2014which are frequent, extremely long and convoluted\u2014he continues to quote four fundamental strategic priorities in his reasoning. First, there\u2019s the humiliation of the collapse of the USSR and how, in his view, the US took advantage of a gravely weakened Russia. Second, there\u2019s his bitter resentment of what he describes as the expansion of NATO \u2018to within spitting distance\u2019 of Russia. Third, there\u2019s Putin\u2019s attitude to Ukraine and what he claims is the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians as \u2018one people.\u2019 And fourth, there\u2019s his aim to reconstruct Russia as a great power (velikaya derzhava) and to have the West accept Moscow\u2019s dominance in its sphere of influence over its former Soviet territories.Bat Chen Feldman, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and Arkady Mil-Man. Putin and Erdogan Meet in Sochi: Another Challenge to the Western Bloc, Institute for National Security Studies, published August 16, 2022.The meeting in Sochi on August 5, 2022 between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, not long after their meeting in Tehran at the Astana Forum, reflects deepening cooperation between Moscow and Ankara. Moscow needs Ankara, partly in order to limit the negative economic ramifications of the war in Ukraine, but also to further weaken NATO from within. For its part, Ankara needs Moscow because of Russian influence in what it sees as main conflict zones\u2014Syria, the Caucasus, and Libya, and given its dependence on Russia in matters of energy.Bryan Frederick, Samuel Charap, Scott Boston, Stephen J. Flanagan, Michael J. Mazarr, Jennifer D. P. Moroney, and Karl P. Mueller, Pathways to Russian Escalation Against NATO from the Ukraine War, RAND Corporation, published July 2022.\u2026public outcry against Russian war crimes could create the impression of a political drive to intervene. The brutality of Russia\u2019s campaign in Ukraine appears likely to continue, which, in turn, will further increase public outrage in NATO countries and amplify calls to take action that would stop the carnage. With the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia already at near-maximum levels, there will likely be intensifying calls in key NATO capitals for more-direct military actions to defeat Russia or otherwise coerce it into stopping its campaign.Tatiana Stanovaya, Chapter 2 The Russian State and Society at a Crossroads: The twilight zone, from Russian Futures 2030, European Institute for Security Studies, published August 2020.For some Russia may seem a\u00a0 \u2018quiet swamp\u2019 \u2013 a country with a resilient, albeit stagnating, economy and a highly controlled political system. This fosters the perception that Russia is a society in the grip of powerful forces of inertia fundamentally incapable of change, destined to continue to be ruled by the incumbent political regime for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, the image may suggest that there are tensions lurking beneath the surface of Russian society, carrying a latent risk of sudden explosion. In this vein, there is indeed widespread speculation within the opposition camp about when and how fast the ruling regime may implode. According to this viewpoint, behind its fa\u00e7ade of authoritarian strength the Russian political establishment is being gradually eroded by internal schisms and fragmentation. One of the big questions concerning the future of Russia is exactly this: is the current political system capable of change and, if so, what kind of change might we see in the future and what role will society play in these transformations? [p. 26]Janis Kluge, Chapter 3 Russia\u2019s Economy: from dusk till dawn?, from Russian Futures 2030, European Institute for Security Studies, published August 2020Russia\u2019s economy is commonly seen as its weak point, casting a shadow over any assessment of the country\u2019s future prospects. While booming oil prices led to fast economic growth in the 2000s despite a lack of structural reforms, Russia\u2019s economy lost its impetus when energy revenues began to stagnate in the 2010s. The country\u2019s rather bleak long-term economic outlook creates risks for domestic stability and may have negative implications for its foreign and military policy. Whether Russia will move beyond its current economic model in the decade leading up to 2030 depends mainly on political developments in both the domestic and the international arena. Technological and environmental changes, in contrast, can be expected to have a more gradual impact, but they play an important role as a catalyst of political developments. In the upcoming decade, the combination of these factors could set Russia on a course to economic isolation and decline, or alternatively lead to closer integration with the international economy. [p. 43]Philip G. Wasielewski, Seth G. Jones and Joseph S. Bermudez, Jr., Russia\u2019s Gamble in Ukraine, Center for Strategic & International Studies, published January 2022.\u00a0\u201cIf Moscow invades or otherwise escalates its actions in Ukraine and other areas, the United States and its Western partners need to be prepared to conduct extensive diplomatic, economic, military and information measures designed to protect NATO\u2019s eastern flank and prevent Moscow from annexing any additional territory in Ukraine.\u201d [Introduction, p. 1]Historians and Other Experts On Russia and UkraineDavid Matsaberidze, \u201cRussia vs. EU/US through Georgia and Ukraine,\u201d Connections 14, no. 2 (2015): 77\u201386.The article\u2026explore[s] the main topics of Russian foreign policy since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On the one hand based on orthodox geopolitics, as a legitimizing narrative for its sphere of influence across the FSU area, and on the other, the narrative of victimization of Russia and Russians by the West after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [\u2026] Russia is fighting against its status as a second rate country, and the evident clash of Western liberal democracy and Russian orthodoxy in the Russian Federation\u2019s foreign policy drive. The Rose and Orange revolutions of Georgia and Ukraine are considered to be major security problems by the Russian Federation, which in turn gives Georgia and Ukraine reason to leave the Russian geo-political axis.Uzochukwu Uchechukwu Alutu, \u201cThe Russia-Ukraine War: Is Africa the Beautiful Bride?\u201d Journal of International Affairs 75, no. 2 (2023): 407\u201313.Despite these challenges, many African countries have yet to denounce Russia. The votes cast by African counties on UN resolutions regarding Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, as shown in Table 1, indicate shifting dynamics in the continent\u2019s relationship with Russia, the rest of EU, and indeed the U.S. In particular, the spread of the votes suggests that while Russia has long enjoyed strong ties with many African countries, such ties may be overstated and are not without conditions.Austin Charron, \u201cWhose Is Crimea? Contested Sovereignty and Regional Identity,\u201d Region 5, no. 2 (2016): 225\u201356.While the Kremlin has continually strived to maintain plausible deniability of its support for separatist groups in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region and its direct involvement in the violent conflict there, it has openly celebrated and stubbornly defended its territorial annexation of Crimea despite international condemnation, economic sanctions, and mounting pariahdom. The \u201creunification\u201d of Crimea and Russia has also galvanized the Russian public behind a reinvigorated sense of patriotic nationalism, with the catchphrase \u201cCrimea is Ours\u201d (\u201cKrym Nash\u201d) serving as a popular and defiant refrain against challenges to the perception of Russia\u2019s legitimate sovereignty over the region. Russian claims to Crimea draw from a deep well of historical mythologies that enshrine the region within narratives of religious identity, valorous militarism, and Soviet nostalgia.Olena Nikolayenko, Invisible Revolutionaries: Women\u2019s Participation in the Revolution of Dignity, Comparative Politics, Vol. 52, No. 3 (April 2020), pp.451\u2013472.The Revolution of Dignity falls into the category of what Mark Beissinger defines as an \u201curban civic revolution,\u201d marked by a large concentration of protesters in the urban space and popular demands for political freedoms. Since 1980, two-thirds of revolutions worldwide were urban civic revolts, and the proposed typology seeks to catalogue forms of women\u2019s participation in this subset of revolutions. Between November 2013 and February 2014, protesters occupied the Independence Square (Maidan Nezalehnosti, or simply Maidan) in the capital city of Kyiv and pressed for the resignation of the incumbent government, the signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union, and state provision of greater political and economic freedoms. The number of protesters swelled from a few hundred to tens of thousands, with the growth of the encampment in Kyiv and the emergence of smaller protest camps across Ukraine. The mass mobilization resulted in the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 and the conduct of snap presidential elections in May 2014. [p. 452]Mayhill C. Fowler, \u201cBeyond Ukraine or Little Russia: Going Global with Culture in Ukraine,\u201d Harvard Ukrainian Studies 34, no. 1/4 (2015): 259\u201384.Investigating culture in Ukraine outside the ethnic lens raises question of what makes culture \u201cUkrainian.\u201d Rather than quantity to be assumed, \u201cUkrainian culture\u201d demands examination. Members of cultural elites\u2026were directly involved creating \u201cUkrainian\u201d culture. But what was that, exactly? [Cultural elites] were deeply invested in the creation of Ukrainian culture, but no one on what that culture should include. Moreover, this construction Ukrainian culture took place simultaneously with the reevaluation and rearticulation of other ethnic cultures.Lada Kolomiyets, Manipulative Mistranslations in Official Documents and Media Discourses on Contemporary Ukraine, Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Vol. 37, No. 3/4 (2020), pp. 367\u2013406.[T]he main reasons for a significant spread of deforming tendencies in translations of the Ukrainian language material appearing, in particular, in the Russian digital media and blogosphere should be associated not so much with the deficiencies of processing the source language material per se as with the subversive and insinuating strategies of indirect (de- and recontextualized) translation. [p. 404]Beatrix Fut\u00e0k-Campbell, Political Synergy: How the European Far-Right and Russia Have Joined Forces Against Brussels, Atlantisch Perspectief, Vol. 44, No. 1, Special Edition: Putin\u2019s Russia (2020), pp. 30\u201335.Confirming their support for Russia, right-wing populists used the Ukraine crisis and subsequent Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 to their own advantage. These events have produced a key opportunity for them to differentiate themselves from the domestic political mainstream which was anti-Russian. Le Pen has even publicly declared Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion and seizure of Crimea to be legitimate. During the March 2014 referendum on Crimea\u2019s reunification with Russia, high-ranking politicians of the FN and the FP\u00d6 functioned as independent election monitors while OSCE and UN delegations abstained. Notably FP\u00d6 deputy Johann Gudenus and Aymeric Chauprade (FN) were part of the monitoring team and worked together building on their previous meetings at the various summits as noted above. The Eurasian Observatory of Elections and Democracy, which had previously helped to legitimate elections in Transnistria, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia, also invited the PVV to join; however, Wilders declined to participate. Nonetheless, the international observers concluded that the referendum procedure was \u201cfair and free\u201d and \u201cconformed to international standards.\u201d This was in complete contradiction to the international community\u2019s verdict. The UN General Assembly, by adopting resolution 68/262 in March 2014, concluded that the referendum was invalid. Similarly, the European Commission (2014), together with the European Council, declared that the EU \u201cdoes neither recognise the illegal and illegitimate referendum in Crimea nor its outcome.\u201d [p. 33]Carl Gershman, A Fight for Democracy: Why Ukraine Matters, World Affairs, Vol. 177, No. 6 (March / April 2015), pp. 47\u201356.\u201cThe Maidan uprising was not only a momentous historical event but also a profoundly democratic one, with the protesters embracing a concept of citizenship involving individual responsibility to uphold democratic values and to serve the larger community.\u201d [p. 48]\u201cI suggest that Putin seeks nothing less than a different kind of world order from the one that followed the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, which he has called \u201cthe greatest geopolitical tragedy of the twentieth century.\u201d That\u2019s why he \u201c[drove] a tank over the world order,\u201d as the Economist put it last March after the invasion and annexation of Crimea. Putin is seeking to reverse the verdict of 1989, as the American writer George Weigel has said, which he considers to be an unjust and humiliating defeat for Russia.\u201d [p. 52]Jacobus Delwaide, Identity and Geopolitics: Ukraine\u2019s Grappling with Imperial Legacies, Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Vol. 32/33, Part 1: \u0416\u041d\u0418\u0412\u0410: Essays Presented in Honor of George G. Grabowicz on His Seventieth Birthday (2011\u20132014), pp. 179\u2013207.Russian historic claims to Ukraine are not at all obvious. The term Kyivan Rus\u2019 for the medieval (late ninth to mid-thirteenth century) realm centered on Kyiv \u201ccomes from imperial Russian historiography,\u201d and had the function of distinguishing the Kyivan from the Muscovite period in the imperial Russian narrative. After World War II, the notion of an \u201cOld Rus\u2019 nationality\u201d gained particular momentum in Soviet historiography: it \u201cserved, inter alia, to establish Russia\u2019s claim to the historical legacy of Kyivan Rus\u2019 and therefore survived the demise of Soviet historiography \u201d remaining \u201cquite popular in Russia today..\u201d [Kyiv and Muscovy, p. 180]Alexander J. Motyl, Deleting the Holodomor: Ukraine Unmakes Itself, World Affairs, Vol. 173, No. 3 (September/October 2010), pp. 25\u201333.\u201cThe first thing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich did after his February 25 inauguration was delete the link to the Holodomor on the president\u2019s official Web site. Yanukovich\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Yushchenko, had made the Holodomor\u2013the famine of 1932-33 produced by Joseph Stalin and responsible for the deaths of millions of Ukrainian peasants\u2013into a national issue, promoting what Czech novelist Milan Kundera famously called \u201cthe struggle of memory over forgetting\u201d as part of his attempt to move the country toward democracy.\u201d [p. 25]\u201c[T]he Holodomor\u2019s \u201cmurder by starvation\u201d remains the single greatest catastrophe endured by Ukraine during Soviet rule. Any attempt to reconstruct a national Ukrainian narrative must take a stand on a trauma of such proportions\u2013especially since all Soviet historians, propagandists, and officials assiduously ignored the famine or dismissed it as an emigre delusion for decades.\u201d[p. 27]Timothy Snyder, Integration and Disintegration: Europe, Ukraine, and the World, Slavic Review, Vol. 74, No. 4 (Winter 2015), pp. 695\u2013707.\u201cThe aspirations of Ukrainians in 2013 and 2014, and in particular the desire for an association agreement with the EU, now come into clearer focus. The Yanukovych regime had the support of much of the population when its policy was to sign the association agreement and lost it when it yielded to Russian pressure not to sign. Citizens of Ukraine, perhaps more than anyone else, were in a position to appreciate the logic of European integration in its latest form. Ukraine has been near the center of several of the major integrative and disintegrative projects of the European twentieth century. It did not become a nation-state, despite a serious military effort, after World War I; instead, most of the lands of today\u2019s Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union. It was the major German European colony of World War I and was meant to be the major German colony in World War II. No country was shaped more by the accumulating effect of the Nazi and Soviet projects of transformation.\u201d [p. 702]Kazuhiko Togo, \u201cAn Alternative Way to Face the Ukrainian War,\u201d The Journal of Territorial and Maritime Studies 10, no. 2 (2023): 86\u201396.If majority views are going to prevail, and Zelensky continues on insisting on his essential war purposes\u2014to achieve full territorial integrity, chase out Russian troops from all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, force Putin to accept full defeat\u2014there is a real danger for escalation and prolongation of deadly fighting. The end game of the war may be considerable bloodshed of Ukrainians and Russians until that full victory of the West can be achieved.But if minority views are put on trial, what would the minimal necessary conditions be to achieve a ceasefire? It goes without saying that the most difficult condition is the question of Ukrainian territorial integrity.Support JSTOR Daily!

Ukraine\u2019s successes are not guaranteed to endure, and at the moment, momentum seems to be shifting at least modestly in Russia\u2019s favor.\u201dTwo years after Russia\u2019s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, Michael O\u2019Hanlon takes stock of where the war stands and what happens if the U.S. House of Representatives fails to authorize additional financial and military aid.Related material:\u00a0Does the West\u2019s Ukraine policy need a reality check? A Brookings debateDoes the West\u2019s Ukraine policy need a reality check? (online event)Ukraine remains stronger than you might thinkWill Congress keep Ukraine in the fight?TRANSCRIPTPITA:\u00a0Russia\u2019s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine has lasted two full years, as of February 24th. The Ukrainian military and people have shown incredible resilience. Meanwhile, for those not in the trenches, the war has shaken perceptions of European security and continues to reshape NATO and other aspects of U.S.-European security architecture.As Brookings scholars are taking stock of the current state of the war, several of them took part in a \u201creality check\u201d on U.S. and European policy, debating some of the major questions facing Ukraine and its supporters. We\u2019ll have a link to the written document in the show notes, or you can also go to brookings.edu slash events to find the live-action version, an online discussion with five of the authors on Friday morning. With us today is one of those authors, Mike O\u2019Hanlon, senior fellow and director of the Strobe Talbot Center for Security, Strategy and Technology here at Brookings. Mike, welcome back.O\u2019HANLON: Adrianna, thank you. It\u2019s nice to be with you.PITA: So, one of the questions you and our colleagues addressed was, \u201cis Russia winning?\u201d And I\u2019m going to ask you to dig into that a little bit today. Could you start with giving us a big picture overview of the current situation on the battlefield?O\u2019HANLON: Well, thank you. And let\u2019s start big picture in time as well as space. Because if we think about two years since the all-out invasion began, and really you were very accurate in saying that was when the all-out attack occurred, but it\u2019s really now 10 years since Russia grabbed Crimea and then started fomenting separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. So, it\u2019s really a decade-long war at this point, at some level. But if we look at it over that two-to-10-year time horizon, Russia is not winning. Because Russia wanted more than Crimea. Russia wanted to invalidate the basic idea of Ukraine as a country and either take it or Lukashenko-ify it. In other words, Lukashenko being the president of Belarus just to the north of Ukraine, widely seen as a Putin lackey and extremely deferential to Russia. At a minimum, Putin wanted one of his own puppets, essentially, in power in Kyiv. And at a maximum, he wanted to take a big chunk or all of the country.He\u2019s often argued, including in his infamous essay in the summer of 2021, that you can find if you Google Putin, Kremlin, Ukraine essay summer 2021. He\u2019s argued there and elsewhere, like with this Tucker Carlson interview, that Ukraine\u2019s not even a real country, that somehow, its territorial definition and scope and size have fluctuated over the years, which may be true, but there\u2019s still been something called Ukraine for really a millennium. And he\u2019ll say, well, Russia and Ukraine had a common origin in Kyiv, and therefore Kyiv is really more Russian than Ukrainian. Well, it\u2019s true they had a common origin in Kyiv, but I could use that same fact to argue that Russia is not the real country; Russia\u2019s derivative of an original Ukrainian identity and split off from that and later created Moscow.So, Putin\u2019s arguments are extremely self-serving. And they have tiny kernels of truth, but they\u2019re ridiculous on balance. Problem is Putin believes them, or he certainly is willing to use them and try to get the rest of us to believe that he\u2019s got a right to all of Ukraine, or at least the vast preponderance of it. So, by that standard, he\u2019s failed because he\u2019s only now holding 18% of the country, and he\u2019s stuck. It\u2019s very hard for Russia to make more progress beyond that. And the Western world has remained extremely committed to Ukraine\u2019s survival and President Zelenskyy and his government are still in place. So, I think in these big picture terms, Putin has failed. But unfortunately, he does have 18% of Ukraine. He probably will be able to hold on to that, or most of it, for a very long time to come. He still has the possibility of slowing down the war and then picking it up at a later date and maybe being more successful then. He may find a way to assassinate Zelenskyy or otherwise weaken the government.And so, I don\u2019t want to say that any success so far by Ukraine is permanent and guaranteed to endure. And in fact, maybe what you were really getting at with your question, in recent weeks, I would say momentum has shifted at least modestly towards Russia\u2019s advantage, as Ukraine, of course, has been denied further American assistance for the moment, has failed in its big 2023 counteroffensive, and has continued to suffer air and missile attacks from Russia, some of which it can shoot down, some of which it can\u2019t. So when you put all that together, Ukraine\u2019s a little bit on its heels, and of course there\u2019s no end in sight, and with Donald Trump running for president of the United States with a long-standing ambivalence or even antipathy against Ukraine, and favorable views towards President Putin, and a promise to all of us that he\u2019ll end the war within a day once he\u2019s in the White House again, with that kind of an attitude coming from the person who currently leads our presidential polls, I think Putin takes some solace in thinking that time is on his side more than it is on Ukraine\u2019s.So, on balance, Russia has failed in its biggest goals, but those failures may be reversed. Ukraine\u2019s successes are not guaranteed to endure, and at the moment, momentum seems to be shifting at least modestly in Russia\u2019s favor.PITA: Okay, let me dig into some questions of Russian supply chains, basically. In terms of materiel and arms, in that first year we saw some hopeful signs that the Russian military maybe wasn\u2019t as advanced or sufficiently equipped as had been feared. There was lots of Soviet-era equipment spotted, there were trucks, I think heavy transports that kept being found abandoned because the tires were literally disintegrating under them. But that situation obviously hasn\u2019t continued. What do we know about the current state of Russia\u2019s arms supplies, in terms of their domestic production or what they\u2019re getting from Iran, North Korea, other external sources? What does that look like and how sustainable is that supply?O\u2019HANLON: Yeah, Russia had a bad year in 2022, but they have recovered. And they figured out how to manufacture what they most need. Four million artillery shells per year, for example, which is roughly twice what the entire Western world can do in aggregate. And as you point out, they\u2019ve also received ballistic missiles and drones from North Korea and Iran. And luckily China\u2019s not providing them weapons. That\u2019s an important point to bear in mind because we are seeing some limits to the China-Russia collaboration so far. And that\u2019s important for a lot of reasons, including how we think about China policy.But Russia\u2019s got what it needs, and it\u2019s got enough people to man that frontline position and prevent Ukraine from having any particularly successful counteroffensive over the course of the last 12 months. And I think that will remain true into 2024. I don\u2019t see Ukraine having very good prospects of taking back territory this year either, because Russia has manned this 600-mile front pretty well. It\u2019s refitted its forces. It\u2019s called up more people. It\u2019s of course taken prisoners into its military, it\u2019s treated its own people very badly and the estimate is that more than 300,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Ukrainian war in two years, which is a dramatically higher loss rate than they even had in the Afghanistan war of the 1980s So it\u2019s quite deadly and of course Russia does have four times the population base of Ukraine, so unfortunately, even though Russia\u2019s suffering 50% higher casualty rate than Ukraine, Russia can endure that.And Putin doesn\u2019t feel that he has to slow down the offensives or the fight. He has, as our old colleague, Jung Pak used to say about Kim Jong-Un, Vladimir Putin has a very high tolerance level for other people\u2019s pain, including his own fellow Russians, as long as they\u2019re people from the hinterlands who don\u2019t have political clout and the ability to challenge him in his domestic standing or his upcoming presidential election.So, Russia\u2019s got what it needs to keep fighting the way it\u2019s fighting. I don\u2019t know if Russia has serious prospects for taking back a lot of Ukraine based on new things militarily they might do. I think Russia\u2019s main hopes for taking more of Ukraine center on American politics, both with the aid bill this year and the looming presidential election in November. But in the meantime, Putin\u2019s not gonna feel he has to slow down, because again, he\u2019s got the core elements of continuing this current fight, and he certainly seems to have the stomach to watch his own and other countries\u2019 soldiers and civilians die and not really seem to care.PITA: Are there any indications about whether the Russian people share that we don\u2019t care about it so much? Of course, I\u2019m sure the casualty numbers aren\u2019t really being widely published, but are there any indications about how public sentiment is, whether there\u2019s been any change in how they view the war?O\u2019HANLON: Well, unfortunately, the Russian population, many Russian citizens, are supportive of this war, and there are two main things that Putin\u2019s done to sustain that. One is he tells this fairy tale narrative of how the war started and who the opposition is. And he calls Zelenskyy a Nazi, even though Zelenskyy is Jewish. And he says that it was a war of aggression by NATO, even though Ukraine\u2019s not in NATO, and there are no NATO troops on Ukrainian soil and Ukraine itself of course did not start this war. So, he tells that story and a lot of people believe him or at least parts of it, at least the broader web of conspiracy that the Western world is always encroaching on Russia, and this is a reminder of what happened in the world wars and blah blah blah. So that\u2019s part of his strategy and he does get a fair amount of complicity from many Russians, but he knows not to push his luck.So, the second part of his strategy is to have most of the human toll that this war exacts on Russia as a society be exacted in those remote regions. Populations that are less well-informed, that are less positioned to object politically to Putin\u2019s rule or to people like prisoners who have nowhere else to go and aren\u2019t regarded well by the rest of society, that he\u2019ll disproportionately tap for his human wave attacks that they\u2019ve been employing so much, including recently in Avdiivka and other places where they\u2019ve had sometimes limited tactical success in the last couple of years, even though they haven\u2019t really netted any great territorial advantage for Russia. The war has been sort of stuck at Russia holding 18 percent of Ukraine for more than a year.So that\u2019s Putin\u2019s strategy. Tell a fairy tale about who caused the war and why they did so, and then keep the war out of the big cities and the elites. Don\u2019t have it affect them or their families so much. And I\u2019m afraid that strategy is working pretty well.PITA: Military and financial aid on the scale that Ukraine needs is of course going to require congressional authority from the U.S. However, if the Speaker of the House won\u2019t relent on bringing the current aid package to the floor, and if Republican members aren\u2019t willing to join Democrats in any sort of procedural maneuvers to force the bill to the floor without his approval, is there anything that the Biden administration can do, or maybe already is doing, that does not require congressional approval that will at least keep some small amount of aid and armaments continuing to Ukraine?O\u2019HANLON: Adrianna, it\u2019s a great question, and I wish I had a better answer for you in terms of an encouraging answer. Because at least Congress hasn\u2019t explicitly cut off aid in the sense of banning it. If Biden were to find some clever way to do what you\u2019re saying, it wouldn\u2019t be like the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, where Congress had said to the Reagan administration, thou shalt not give funds or weapons to the insurgents in Nicaragua. And then the Reagan administration went around them, went around Congress, broke the law, sold weapons to Iran to get cash, to then buy other weapons for the resistance in Nicaragua and just blatantly broke the law. In this case, if you could find some other source of money or weaponry that was sitting around, you might be able to tap into it. But we\u2019ve already more or less run out of that. Biden\u2019s made it clear, and I think rightly so, as president that he would only use official presidential drawdown authority to the extent authorized, and he would be very public about doing that, which means he could tap into American weapon stocks, but only to a certain extent. And Congress would have to effectively authorize even that. And Congress certainly would need to appropriate any money we would give directly to Ukraine, or any money we would use to replenish our own weapon stockpiles by buying more arms from defense industry. So, basically, it\u2019s all been done above the board and by the books, which is to the credit of President Biden and the right way to do it. But unfortunately, that means that when you run out of that explicit authority, you\u2019ve run out. And I suppose he could ask for private donations of money to Ukraine from American citizens. But in terms of selling weaponry, no, I don\u2019t know any other way to do it.PITA: All right, Mike, thank you very much for your time today. And again, I\u2019ll encourage our listeners to take a look for the full written debate and for the live discussion that you\u2019ll be taking part in.O\u2019HANLON: Well, thank you very much and also a big shout out to my colleagues and yours who have helped so much with this Ukraine Index project that we\u2019ve built and that has a lot of data on the Brookings website and also in yesterday\u2019s Washington Post under my byline. So, I got to enjoy the primary glory for the work, which was very good work, but it was your colleagues in Communications and mine in Foreign Policy who assembled and presented the data. So, it\u2019s been a nice team effort here at Brookings.PITA: Wonderful. Thanks very much, Mike.O\u2019HANLON: Thanks, Adrianna.\u00a0 More OnUkraineDefense & SecurityInternational Affairs      Sub-Topics    Diplomacy & Multilateralism U.S. Foreign Policy EuropeRussiaProgramForeign Policy RegionEurope Russia Ukraine CenterStrobe Talbott Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology Ukraine remains stronger than you might thinkUkraine        Ukraine remains stronger than you might think                    Michael E.
