The EU and US are contemplating new sanctions against Russia, partly in response to continuing warfare, partly as a reaction to the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Russia has taken the Ukrainian city of Avdiivka, apparently suffering tremendous military losses while doing so, and Canada has agreed to expand Ukraine\u2019s drone warfare capabilities. Rocket and air strikes continue to kill civilians.We first published this reading list on March 1, 2022. Since then,we\u2019ve been updating it on a regular basis.

Hooker, Kimberly Talley, and Anca Agachi, \u201cA SECURITY STRATEGY FOR THE BLACK SEA,\u201d Atlantic Council, published December 1, 2023.An unstable Black Sea region directly threatens the peace and prosperity of the North Atlantic community, a bedrock of US foreign policy since 1945. Russian aggression in the Black Sea region threatens the security of every Black Sea state and the Euro-Atlantic region as a whole, as well as global food security, international economic stability, and the viability of international legal frameworks. These represent key and important interests for the United States, as well as Europe.Lo\u00efc Simonet, \u201cTrends in International Politics 2024: From \u2018as Long as It Takes\u2019 to \u2018as Long as We Can\u2019: Will the West Abandon Ukraine?\u201d OIIP \u2013 Austrian Institute for International Affairs, published January 1, 2024.On 8 June 2023, in a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, U.S. President Joe Biden said he believes the United States has the funds to \u201csupport Ukraine as long as it takes\u201d (The White House, 2023 a). Six months later, at his joint press conference with V. Zelensky, Biden\u2019s tone had a worrying nuance: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to supply Ukraine with critical weapons and equipment as long as we can\u201d (White House, 2023 b). The fact is that, in the meantime, aid for Ukraine has become a partisan issue, which makes its prospects ever less certain.Emma Schroeder and Sean Dack, \u201cA PARALLEL TERRAIN: Public-Private Defense of the Ukrainian Information Environment,\u201d Atlantic Council, published January 1, 2024.Russian assaults on the Ukrainian information environment are conducted against, and through, largely privately owned infrastructure, and Ukrainian defense in this space is likewise bound up in cooperative efforts with those infrastructure owners and other technology companies providing aid and assistance. The role of private companies in this conflict seems likely to grow, along with the scale, complexity, and criticality of the information infrastructure they operate. Examining and mitigating the risks related to the involvement of private technology companies in the war in Ukraine is crucial and looking forward, the United States government must also examine the same questions with regard to its own security and defense.Daniel Shapiro, \u201cYear Two of the Invasion: Where Do Former Soviet Countries Stand?\u201d European Leadership Network, published June 2023.Ukraine\u2019s most novel contribution to the field of anti-corruption, however, has been its extensive public disclosures of who owns what throughout the political-economic system. Reformers were tired of corruption investigations running into dead ends in the form of anonymously owned companies, fancy cars and properties with unknown owners, secret information about public procurements, and politicians who lied about their wealth and income.Georgy Poroskoun and Yaron Gamburg, \u201cChanging Israel\u2019s Policy on Russia and Ukraine,\u201d Institute for National Security Studies, published January 3, 2024.Common understandings of the Wagner Group tend to over-emphasize its military strength or focus on the ineffectiveness of its mercenary troops. Instead, this report illustrates how its military capacity and operations vary significantly across different conflict theaters.Emily Winterbotham, \u201cThe Impact of Gendered Narratives in the Conflict in Ukraine,\u201d Global Center on Cooperative Security, published August 2023.Traditional gendered narratives have often been resurrected by all sides to the Ukraine conflict, with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s appeal to women, mothers, sisters, and fianc\u00e9es to support their loved ones in battle; the image beamed around the world of a wounded, pregnant Ukrainian woman curled on a stretcher; and comments made by the UK defense secretary that President Putin is suffering from \u201csmall man syndrome\u201d providing just some examples.Gustav Gressel, \u201cBEYOND THE COUNTER-OFFENSIVE: ATTRITION, STALEMATE, AND THE FUTURE OF THE WAR IN UKRAINE,\u201d European Council on Foreign Relations, published January 1, 2024.The Russian war against Ukraine has become a war of attrition. Such a conflict will impose enormous costs on both sides, but over time it will favour Russia. The Russian defence-industrial base cannot compensate for Russia\u02bcs current loss rates, but it can replace its equipment faster than the West is, as of now, willing to do for Ukraine. For the time being at least, a war of attrition implies a Russian victory.This outcome is far from inevitable. But Ukraine cannot overcome Russia in a war of attrition without stepped-up Western assistance.Danish Institute for International Studies, \u201cENERGY AS A WEAPON: DECODING BLACKMAIL TACTICS IN EUROPE,\u201d Danish Institute for International Studies, published January 2024.\u201cEnergy blackmail\u201d became a buzzword following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent energy crisis, but the phenomenon is not new. Energy blackmail has been employed by states to leverage their strategic energy resources for decades. In Europe, the weaponisation of energy predates Vladimir Putin\u2019s time in Kremlin. Despite EU efforts to diversify its energy supply, the threat of energy blackmail persists, posing challenges not only to traditional energy dependencies but also to the increasingly digitalised energy sector.Alicja Bachulska and Mark Leonard, \u201cChina and Ukraine: The Chinese Debate about Russia\u2019s War and Its Meaning for the World,\u201d European Council on Foreign Relations, published July 2023.This policy brief sets out to understand the ways in which China\u02bcs political and intellectual elites see the war in Ukraine. It draws four key lessons from more than 30 off-the-record interviews undertaken by the authors with Chinese thinkers and strategists in top universities, think-tanks, and party-affiliated organs, and from the study of articles and debates in the Chinese foreign policy community. Their views are complemented by an analysis of official Chinese documents and an extensive literature review of academic journals and media accounts relating to the war in Ukraine.Dick Zandee and Ad\u00e1ja Stoetman, \u201cThe War in Ukraine: Adapting the EU\u2019s Security and Defence Policy,\u201d Clingendael Institute, published July 2023.Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is violating the rules-based international order and poses a significant threat to European security. The EU and NATO have responded by taking coordinated action. The measures taken have varied from unprecedented sanctions on Russia to assisting Ukraine with the delivery of arms and ammunition. The war in Ukraine has led to an even stronger focus on collective defence, which was already put in motion after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Furthermore, the European security architecture has witnessed a significant change with Finland (and later this year Sweden) joining the North Atlantic Alliance. At the Vilnius Summit (11-12 July 2023), NATO has taken new decisions to strengthen its deterrence and defence posture.Clara Portela, \u201cThe EU and the Transformed Nuclear Context since the War in Ukraine,\u201d Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI), published May 11, 2023.But it was, above all, the more or less explicit threats of nuclear-weapons use issued repeatedly throughout 2022 by Russia\u2019s leaders\u2014notably President Vladimir Putin himself\u2014that commanded the most attention from media and policy circles. No less than 165 \u201cinteractions with a nuclear dimension\u201d were observed in the course of barely one year. What impact are such actions having on European security?Michal Smetana, \u201cDo Europeans (Still) Support Arms Control Talks with Russia?\u201d Peace Research Center Prague, published November 2023. Would the European public support new arms control negotiations with Moscow in the current international security environment? Recent evidence suggests that despite Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and generally hostile foreign policy directed toward the collective West, engaging Russia in arms control talks would be met with broad societal approval.Max Bergmann, What Could Come Next?: Assessing the Putin Regime\u2019s Stability and Western Policy Options, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), published January 2023.The potential for Ukrainian military success to cause regime instability in Moscow has generated understandable nervousness among many Western governments about what could follow Putin. In fact, there is a growing assumption that what follows his reign could very well be worse. Such a pessimistic outlook might seem sober\u2014but, as this issue brief argues, it could very well be wrong.Samuel Charap and Miranda Priebe, Avoiding a Long War: U.S. Policy and the Trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, RAND Corporation, published January 2023.The trajectory and ultimate outcome of the war will, of course, be determined largely by the policies of Ukraine and Russia. But Kyiv and Moscow are not the only capitals with a stake in what happens. This war is the most significant interstate conflict in decades, and its evolution will have major consequences for the United States. It is appropriate to assess how this conflict may evolve, what alternative trajectories might mean for U.S. interests, and what Washington can do to promote a trajectory that best serves U.S. interests.Davis Ellison, \u201cDangerous Waters: Contextualising Maritime Technological Trends for the Post-Ukraine War World,\u201d in Maritime Security in a Time of Renewed Interstate Competition: Navigating the Royal Netherlands Navy through the Geopolitical and Technological Challenges and Threats in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Regions, Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, published January 2024.In the second month of Russia\u2019s invasion, the Black Sea flagship Moskva was sunk after being struck by two Ukrainian-made R-360 \u2018Neptune\u2019 anti-ship missiles. The Moskva was the largest warship to be sunk in combat since the Falklands War. The naval aspect of this war has included, among other elements, the large use of missiles and combined use of airborne and maritime drones to harass naval assets both at sea and in port. 38 Altogether, the experience of the Russian Black Sea fleet has been a dangerous one, likely in ways that were not anticipated in Moscow or in many other capitals.These battlefield developments imply a possible shift in maritime technology away from large, vulnerable surface platforms and towards an emphasis on a massive amount of data collected by many sensors that can constantly feed information to a wide array of strike assets.Max Bergmann, Tina Dolbaia, and Nick Fenton. Russia\u2019s Adaptation Game: Deciphering the Kremlin\u2019s \u201cHumanitarian Policy,\u201d Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), published December 2022.At first glance, the new policy, coming six months after Moscow\u2019s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, seems detached from reality. It describes the Russian Federation as a country that aspires to maintain in the world. \u201cThis has absolutely nothing to do with the reality\u2014the catastrophe into which Russia is plunging itself,\u201d Elena Sorokina, a journalist with the Russian-language multinational and multireligious peace and stability notes branch of Radio Liberty.Jon Bateman, How Militarily Effective Have Russia\u2019s Cyber Operations Been in Ukraine? Russia\u2019s Wartime Cyber Operations in Ukraine: Military Impacts, Influences, and Implications. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, published December 2022.The dissenting camp describes Russian cyber operations as sweeping in scale, tactically effective in key moments, and aligned with Moscow\u2019s military objectives of disrupting, confusing, and cowing the Ukrainian government, armed forces, and civilian population.Andrea Kendall-Taylor, Michael Kofman, Nicholas Lokker, and Heli Hautala, \u201cAssessing the Evolving Russian Nuclear Threat,\u201d Center for a New American Security, published October 1, 2023.From what we know from Putin\u2019s speeches\u2014which are frequent, extremely long and convoluted\u2014he continues to quote four fundamental strategic priorities in his reasoning. First, there\u2019s the humiliation of the collapse of the USSR and how, in his view, the US took advantage of a gravely weakened Russia. Second, there\u2019s his bitter resentment of what he describes as the expansion of NATO \u2018to within spitting distance\u2019 of Russia. Third, there\u2019s Putin\u2019s attitude to Ukraine and what he claims is the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians as \u2018one people.\u2019 And fourth, there\u2019s his aim to reconstruct Russia as a great power (velikaya derzhava) and to have the West accept Moscow\u2019s dominance in its sphere of influence over its former Soviet territories.Bat Chen Feldman, Gallia Lindenstrauss, and Arkady Mil-Man. Putin and Erdogan Meet in Sochi: Another Challenge to the Western Bloc, Institute for National Security Studies, published August 16, 2022.The meeting in Sochi on August 5, 2022 between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, not long after their meeting in Tehran at the Astana Forum, reflects deepening cooperation between Moscow and Ankara. Moscow needs Ankara, partly in order to limit the negative economic ramifications of the war in Ukraine, but also to further weaken NATO from within. For its part, Ankara needs Moscow because of Russian influence in what it sees as main conflict zones\u2014Syria, the Caucasus, and Libya, and given its dependence on Russia in matters of energy.Bryan Frederick, Samuel Charap, Scott Boston, Stephen J. Flanagan, Michael J. Mazarr, Jennifer D. P. Moroney, and Karl P. Mueller, Pathways to Russian Escalation Against NATO from the Ukraine War, RAND Corporation, published July 2022.\u2026public outcry against Russian war crimes could create the impression of a political drive to intervene. The brutality of Russia\u2019s campaign in Ukraine appears likely to continue, which, in turn, will further increase public outrage in NATO countries and amplify calls to take action that would stop the carnage. With the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia already at near-maximum levels, there will likely be intensifying calls in key NATO capitals for more-direct military actions to defeat Russia or otherwise coerce it into stopping its campaign.Tatiana Stanovaya, Chapter 2 The Russian State and Society at a Crossroads: The twilight zone, from Russian Futures 2030, European Institute for Security Studies, published August 2020.For some Russia may seem a\u00a0 \u2018quiet swamp\u2019 \u2013 a country with a resilient, albeit stagnating, economy and a highly controlled political system. This fosters the perception that Russia is a society in the grip of powerful forces of inertia fundamentally incapable of change, destined to continue to be ruled by the incumbent political regime for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, the image may suggest that there are tensions lurking beneath the surface of Russian society, carrying a latent risk of sudden explosion. In this vein, there is indeed widespread speculation within the opposition camp about when and how fast the ruling regime may implode. According to this viewpoint, behind its fa\u00e7ade of authoritarian strength the Russian political establishment is being gradually eroded by internal schisms and fragmentation. One of the big questions concerning the future of Russia is exactly this: is the current political system capable of change and, if so, what kind of change might we see in the future and what role will society play in these transformations? [p. 26]Janis Kluge, Chapter 3 Russia\u2019s Economy: from dusk till dawn?, from Russian Futures 2030, European Institute for Security Studies, published August 2020Russia\u2019s economy is commonly seen as its weak point, casting a shadow over any assessment of the country\u2019s future prospects. While booming oil prices led to fast economic growth in the 2000s despite a lack of structural reforms, Russia\u2019s economy lost its impetus when energy revenues began to stagnate in the 2010s. The country\u2019s rather bleak long-term economic outlook creates risks for domestic stability and may have negative implications for its foreign and military policy. Whether Russia will move beyond its current economic model in the decade leading up to 2030 depends mainly on political developments in both the domestic and the international arena. Technological and environmental changes, in contrast, can be expected to have a more gradual impact, but they play an important role as a catalyst of political developments. In the upcoming decade, the combination of these factors could set Russia on a course to economic isolation and decline, or alternatively lead to closer integration with the international economy. [p. 43]Philip G. Wasielewski, Seth G. Jones and Joseph S. Bermudez, Jr., Russia\u2019s Gamble in Ukraine, Center for Strategic & International Studies, published January 2022.\u00a0\u201cIf Moscow invades or otherwise escalates its actions in Ukraine and other areas, the United States and its Western partners need to be prepared to conduct extensive diplomatic, economic, military and information measures designed to protect NATO\u2019s eastern flank and prevent Moscow from annexing any additional territory in Ukraine.\u201d [Introduction, p. 1]Historians and Other Experts On Russia and UkraineDavid Matsaberidze, \u201cRussia vs. EU/US through Georgia and Ukraine,\u201d Connections 14, no. 2 (2015): 77\u201386.The article\u2026explore[s] the main topics of Russian foreign policy since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On the one hand based on orthodox geopolitics, as a legitimizing narrative for its sphere of influence across the FSU area, and on the other, the narrative of victimization of Russia and Russians by the West after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [\u2026] Russia is fighting against its status as a second rate country, and the evident clash of Western liberal democracy and Russian orthodoxy in the Russian Federation\u2019s foreign policy drive. The Rose and Orange revolutions of Georgia and Ukraine are considered to be major security problems by the Russian Federation, which in turn gives Georgia and Ukraine reason to leave the Russian geo-political axis.Uzochukwu Uchechukwu Alutu, \u201cThe Russia-Ukraine War: Is Africa the Beautiful Bride?\u201d Journal of International Affairs 75, no. 2 (2023): 407\u201313.Despite these challenges, many African countries have yet to denounce Russia. The votes cast by African counties on UN resolutions regarding Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, as shown in Table 1, indicate shifting dynamics in the continent\u2019s relationship with Russia, the rest of EU, and indeed the U.S. In particular, the spread of the votes suggests that while Russia has long enjoyed strong ties with many African countries, such ties may be overstated and are not without conditions.Austin Charron, \u201cWhose Is Crimea? Contested Sovereignty and Regional Identity,\u201d Region 5, no. 2 (2016): 225\u201356.While the Kremlin has continually strived to maintain plausible deniability of its support for separatist groups in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region and its direct involvement in the violent conflict there, it has openly celebrated and stubbornly defended its territorial annexation of Crimea despite international condemnation, economic sanctions, and mounting pariahdom. The \u201creunification\u201d of Crimea and Russia has also galvanized the Russian public behind a reinvigorated sense of patriotic nationalism, with the catchphrase \u201cCrimea is Ours\u201d (\u201cKrym Nash\u201d) serving as a popular and defiant refrain against challenges to the perception of Russia\u2019s legitimate sovereignty over the region. Russian claims to Crimea draw from a deep well of historical mythologies that enshrine the region within narratives of religious identity, valorous militarism, and Soviet nostalgia.Olena Nikolayenko, Invisible Revolutionaries: Women\u2019s Participation in the Revolution of Dignity, Comparative Politics, Vol. 52, No. 3 (April 2020), pp.451\u2013472.The Revolution of Dignity falls into the category of what Mark Beissinger defines as an \u201curban civic revolution,\u201d marked by a large concentration of protesters in the urban space and popular demands for political freedoms. Since 1980, two-thirds of revolutions worldwide were urban civic revolts, and the proposed typology seeks to catalogue forms of women\u2019s participation in this subset of revolutions. Between November 2013 and February 2014, protesters occupied the Independence Square (Maidan Nezalehnosti, or simply Maidan) in the capital city of Kyiv and pressed for the resignation of the incumbent government, the signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union, and state provision of greater political and economic freedoms. The number of protesters swelled from a few hundred to tens of thousands, with the growth of the encampment in Kyiv and the emergence of smaller protest camps across Ukraine. The mass mobilization resulted in the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014 and the conduct of snap presidential elections in May 2014. [p. 452]Mayhill C. Fowler, \u201cBeyond Ukraine or Little Russia: Going Global with Culture in Ukraine,\u201d Harvard Ukrainian Studies 34, no. 1/4 (2015): 259\u201384.Investigating culture in Ukraine outside the ethnic lens raises question of what makes culture \u201cUkrainian.\u201d Rather than quantity to be assumed, \u201cUkrainian culture\u201d demands examination. Members of cultural elites\u2026were directly involved creating \u201cUkrainian\u201d culture. But what was that, exactly? [Cultural elites] were deeply invested in the creation of Ukrainian culture, but no one on what that culture should include. Moreover, this construction Ukrainian culture took place simultaneously with the reevaluation and rearticulation of other ethnic cultures.Lada Kolomiyets, Manipulative Mistranslations in Official Documents and Media Discourses on Contemporary Ukraine, Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Vol. 37, No. 3/4 (2020), pp. 367\u2013406.[T]he main reasons for a significant spread of deforming tendencies in translations of the Ukrainian language material appearing, in particular, in the Russian digital media and blogosphere should be associated not so much with the deficiencies of processing the source language material per se as with the subversive and insinuating strategies of indirect (de- and recontextualized) translation. [p. 404]Beatrix Fut\u00e0k-Campbell, Political Synergy: How the European Far-Right and Russia Have Joined Forces Against Brussels, Atlantisch Perspectief, Vol. 44, No. 1, Special Edition: Putin\u2019s Russia (2020), pp. 30\u201335.Confirming their support for Russia, right-wing populists used the Ukraine crisis and subsequent Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 to their own advantage. These events have produced a key opportunity for them to differentiate themselves from the domestic political mainstream which was anti-Russian. Le Pen has even publicly declared Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion and seizure of Crimea to be legitimate. During the March 2014 referendum on Crimea\u2019s reunification with Russia, high-ranking politicians of the FN and the FP\u00d6 functioned as independent election monitors while OSCE and UN delegations abstained. Notably FP\u00d6 deputy Johann Gudenus and Aymeric Chauprade (FN) were part of the monitoring team and worked together building on their previous meetings at the various summits as noted above. The Eurasian Observatory of Elections and Democracy, which had previously helped to legitimate elections in Transnistria, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia, also invited the PVV to join; however, Wilders declined to participate. Nonetheless, the international observers concluded that the referendum procedure was \u201cfair and free\u201d and \u201cconformed to international standards.\u201d This was in complete contradiction to the international community\u2019s verdict. The UN General Assembly, by adopting resolution 68/262 in March 2014, concluded that the referendum was invalid. Similarly, the European Commission (2014), together with the European Council, declared that the EU \u201cdoes neither recognise the illegal and illegitimate referendum in Crimea nor its outcome.\u201d [p. 33]Carl Gershman, A Fight for Democracy: Why Ukraine Matters, World Affairs, Vol. 177, No. 6 (March / April 2015), pp. 47\u201356.\u201cThe Maidan uprising was not only a momentous historical event but also a profoundly democratic one, with the protesters embracing a concept of citizenship involving individual responsibility to uphold democratic values and to serve the larger community.\u201d [p. 48]\u201cI suggest that Putin seeks nothing less than a different kind of world order from the one that followed the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, which he has called \u201cthe greatest geopolitical tragedy of the twentieth century.\u201d That\u2019s why he \u201c[drove] a tank over the world order,\u201d as the Economist put it last March after the invasion and annexation of Crimea. Putin is seeking to reverse the verdict of 1989, as the American writer George Weigel has said, which he considers to be an unjust and humiliating defeat for Russia.\u201d [p. 52]Jacobus Delwaide, Identity and Geopolitics: Ukraine\u2019s Grappling with Imperial Legacies, Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Vol. 32/33, Part 1: \u0416\u041d\u0418\u0412\u0410: Essays Presented in Honor of George G. Grabowicz on His Seventieth Birthday (2011\u20132014), pp. 179\u2013207.Russian historic claims to Ukraine are not at all obvious. The term Kyivan Rus\u2019 for the medieval (late ninth to mid-thirteenth century) realm centered on Kyiv \u201ccomes from imperial Russian historiography,\u201d and had the function of distinguishing the Kyivan from the Muscovite period in the imperial Russian narrative. After World War II, the notion of an \u201cOld Rus\u2019 nationality\u201d gained particular momentum in Soviet historiography: it \u201cserved, inter alia, to establish Russia\u2019s claim to the historical legacy of Kyivan Rus\u2019 and therefore survived the demise of Soviet historiography \u201d remaining \u201cquite popular in Russia today..\u201d [Kyiv and Muscovy, p. 180]Alexander J. Motyl, Deleting the Holodomor: Ukraine Unmakes Itself, World Affairs, Vol. 173, No. 3 (September/October 2010), pp. 25\u201333.\u201cThe first thing Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich did after his February 25 inauguration was delete the link to the Holodomor on the president\u2019s official Web site. Yanukovich\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Yushchenko, had made the Holodomor\u2013the famine of 1932-33 produced by Joseph Stalin and responsible for the deaths of millions of Ukrainian peasants\u2013into a national issue, promoting what Czech novelist Milan Kundera famously called \u201cthe struggle of memory over forgetting\u201d as part of his attempt to move the country toward democracy.\u201d [p. 25]\u201c[T]he Holodomor\u2019s \u201cmurder by starvation\u201d remains the single greatest catastrophe endured by Ukraine during Soviet rule. Any attempt to reconstruct a national Ukrainian narrative must take a stand on a trauma of such proportions\u2013especially since all Soviet historians, propagandists, and officials assiduously ignored the famine or dismissed it as an emigre delusion for decades.\u201d[p. 27]Timothy Snyder, Integration and Disintegration: Europe, Ukraine, and the World, Slavic Review, Vol. 74, No. 4 (Winter 2015), pp. 695\u2013707.\u201cThe aspirations of Ukrainians in 2013 and 2014, and in particular the desire for an association agreement with the EU, now come into clearer focus. The Yanukovych regime had the support of much of the population when its policy was to sign the association agreement and lost it when it yielded to Russian pressure not to sign. Citizens of Ukraine, perhaps more than anyone else, were in a position to appreciate the logic of European integration in its latest form. Ukraine has been near the center of several of the major integrative and disintegrative projects of the European twentieth century. It did not become a nation-state, despite a serious military effort, after World War I; instead, most of the lands of today\u2019s Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union. It was the major German European colony of World War I and was meant to be the major German colony in World War II. No country was shaped more by the accumulating effect of the Nazi and Soviet projects of transformation.\u201d [p. 702]Kazuhiko Togo, \u201cAn Alternative Way to Face the Ukrainian War,\u201d The Journal of Territorial and Maritime Studies 10, no. 2 (2023): 86\u201396.If majority views are going to prevail, and Zelensky continues on insisting on his essential war purposes\u2014to achieve full territorial integrity, chase out Russian troops from all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, force Putin to accept full defeat\u2014there is a real danger for escalation and prolongation of deadly fighting. The end game of the war may be considerable bloodshed of Ukrainians and Russians until that full victory of the West can be achieved.But if minority views are put on trial, what would the minimal necessary conditions be to achieve a ceasefire? It goes without saying that the most difficult condition is the question of Ukrainian territorial integrity.Support JSTOR Daily!

Ukraine\u2019s successes are not guaranteed to endure, and at the moment, momentum seems to be shifting at least modestly in Russia\u2019s favor.\u201dTwo years after Russia\u2019s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, Michael O\u2019Hanlon takes stock of where the war stands and what happens if the U.S. House of Representatives fails to authorize additional financial and military aid.Related material:\u00a0Does the West\u2019s Ukraine policy need a reality check? A Brookings debateDoes the West\u2019s Ukraine policy need a reality check? (online event)Ukraine remains stronger than you might thinkWill Congress keep Ukraine in the fight?TRANSCRIPTPITA:\u00a0Russia\u2019s full-scale military invasion of Ukraine has lasted two full years, as of February 24th. The Ukrainian military and people have shown incredible resilience. Meanwhile, for those not in the trenches, the war has shaken perceptions of European security and continues to reshape NATO and other aspects of U.S.-European security architecture.As Brookings scholars are taking stock of the current state of the war, several of them took part in a \u201creality check\u201d on U.S. and European policy, debating some of the major questions facing Ukraine and its supporters. We\u2019ll have a link to the written document in the show notes, or you can also go to brookings.edu slash events to find the live-action version, an online discussion with five of the authors on Friday morning. With us today is one of those authors, Mike O\u2019Hanlon, senior fellow and director of the Strobe Talbot Center for Security, Strategy and Technology here at Brookings. Mike, welcome back.O\u2019HANLON: Adrianna, thank you. It\u2019s nice to be with you.PITA: So, one of the questions you and our colleagues addressed was, \u201cis Russia winning?\u201d And I\u2019m going to ask you to dig into that a little bit today. Could you start with giving us a big picture overview of the current situation on the battlefield?O\u2019HANLON: Well, thank you. And let\u2019s start big picture in time as well as space. Because if we think about two years since the all-out invasion began, and really you were very accurate in saying that was when the all-out attack occurred, but it\u2019s really now 10 years since Russia grabbed Crimea and then started fomenting separatist violence in eastern Ukraine. So, it\u2019s really a decade-long war at this point, at some level. But if we look at it over that two-to-10-year time horizon, Russia is not winning. Because Russia wanted more than Crimea. Russia wanted to invalidate the basic idea of Ukraine as a country and either take it or Lukashenko-ify it. In other words, Lukashenko being the president of Belarus just to the north of Ukraine, widely seen as a Putin lackey and extremely deferential to Russia. At a minimum, Putin wanted one of his own puppets, essentially, in power in Kyiv. And at a maximum, he wanted to take a big chunk or all of the country.He\u2019s often argued, including in his infamous essay in the summer of 2021, that you can find if you Google Putin, Kremlin, Ukraine essay summer 2021. He\u2019s argued there and elsewhere, like with this Tucker Carlson interview, that Ukraine\u2019s not even a real country, that somehow, its territorial definition and scope and size have fluctuated over the years, which may be true, but there\u2019s still been something called Ukraine for really a millennium. And he\u2019ll say, well, Russia and Ukraine had a common origin in Kyiv, and therefore Kyiv is really more Russian than Ukrainian. Well, it\u2019s true they had a common origin in Kyiv, but I could use that same fact to argue that Russia is not the real country; Russia\u2019s derivative of an original Ukrainian identity and split off from that and later created Moscow.So, Putin\u2019s arguments are extremely self-serving. And they have tiny kernels of truth, but they\u2019re ridiculous on balance. Problem is Putin believes them, or he certainly is willing to use them and try to get the rest of us to believe that he\u2019s got a right to all of Ukraine, or at least the vast preponderance of it. So, by that standard, he\u2019s failed because he\u2019s only now holding 18% of the country, and he\u2019s stuck. It\u2019s very hard for Russia to make more progress beyond that. And the Western world has remained extremely committed to Ukraine\u2019s survival and President Zelenskyy and his government are still in place. So, I think in these big picture terms, Putin has failed. But unfortunately, he does have 18% of Ukraine. He probably will be able to hold on to that, or most of it, for a very long time to come. He still has the possibility of slowing down the war and then picking it up at a later date and maybe being more successful then. He may find a way to assassinate Zelenskyy or otherwise weaken the government.And so, I don\u2019t want to say that any success so far by Ukraine is permanent and guaranteed to endure. And in fact, maybe what you were really getting at with your question, in recent weeks, I would say momentum has shifted at least modestly towards Russia\u2019s advantage, as Ukraine, of course, has been denied further American assistance for the moment, has failed in its big 2023 counteroffensive, and has continued to suffer air and missile attacks from Russia, some of which it can shoot down, some of which it can\u2019t. So when you put all that together, Ukraine\u2019s a little bit on its heels, and of course there\u2019s no end in sight, and with Donald Trump running for president of the United States with a long-standing ambivalence or even antipathy against Ukraine, and favorable views towards President Putin, and a promise to all of us that he\u2019ll end the war within a day once he\u2019s in the White House again, with that kind of an attitude coming from the person who currently leads our presidential polls, I think Putin takes some solace in thinking that time is on his side more than it is on Ukraine\u2019s.So, on balance, Russia has failed in its biggest goals, but those failures may be reversed. Ukraine\u2019s successes are not guaranteed to endure, and at the moment, momentum seems to be shifting at least modestly in Russia\u2019s favor.PITA: Okay, let me dig into some questions of Russian supply chains, basically. In terms of materiel and arms, in that first year we saw some hopeful signs that the Russian military maybe wasn\u2019t as advanced or sufficiently equipped as had been feared. There was lots of Soviet-era equipment spotted, there were trucks, I think heavy transports that kept being found abandoned because the tires were literally disintegrating under them. But that situation obviously hasn\u2019t continued. What do we know about the current state of Russia\u2019s arms supplies, in terms of their domestic production or what they\u2019re getting from Iran, North Korea, other external sources? What does that look like and how sustainable is that supply?O\u2019HANLON: Yeah, Russia had a bad year in 2022, but they have recovered. And they figured out how to manufacture what they most need. Four million artillery shells per year, for example, which is roughly twice what the entire Western world can do in aggregate. And as you point out, they\u2019ve also received ballistic missiles and drones from North Korea and Iran. And luckily China\u2019s not providing them weapons. That\u2019s an important point to bear in mind because we are seeing some limits to the China-Russia collaboration so far. And that\u2019s important for a lot of reasons, including how we think about China policy.But Russia\u2019s got what it needs, and it\u2019s got enough people to man that frontline position and prevent Ukraine from having any particularly successful counteroffensive over the course of the last 12 months. And I think that will remain true into 2024. I don\u2019t see Ukraine having very good prospects of taking back territory this year either, because Russia has manned this 600-mile front pretty well. It\u2019s refitted its forces. It\u2019s called up more people. It\u2019s of course taken prisoners into its military, it\u2019s treated its own people very badly and the estimate is that more than 300,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in the Ukrainian war in two years, which is a dramatically higher loss rate than they even had in the Afghanistan war of the 1980s So it\u2019s quite deadly and of course Russia does have four times the population base of Ukraine, so unfortunately, even though Russia\u2019s suffering 50% higher casualty rate than Ukraine, Russia can endure that.And Putin doesn\u2019t feel that he has to slow down the offensives or the fight. He has, as our old colleague, Jung Pak used to say about Kim Jong-Un, Vladimir Putin has a very high tolerance level for other people\u2019s pain, including his own fellow Russians, as long as they\u2019re people from the hinterlands who don\u2019t have political clout and the ability to challenge him in his domestic standing or his upcoming presidential election.So, Russia\u2019s got what it needs to keep fighting the way it\u2019s fighting. I don\u2019t know if Russia has serious prospects for taking back a lot of Ukraine based on new things militarily they might do. I think Russia\u2019s main hopes for taking more of Ukraine center on American politics, both with the aid bill this year and the looming presidential election in November. But in the meantime, Putin\u2019s not gonna feel he has to slow down, because again, he\u2019s got the core elements of continuing this current fight, and he certainly seems to have the stomach to watch his own and other countries\u2019 soldiers and civilians die and not really seem to care.PITA: Are there any indications about whether the Russian people share that we don\u2019t care about it so much? Of course, I\u2019m sure the casualty numbers aren\u2019t really being widely published, but are there any indications about how public sentiment is, whether there\u2019s been any change in how they view the war?O\u2019HANLON: Well, unfortunately, the Russian population, many Russian citizens, are supportive of this war, and there are two main things that Putin\u2019s done to sustain that. One is he tells this fairy tale narrative of how the war started and who the opposition is. And he calls Zelenskyy a Nazi, even though Zelenskyy is Jewish. And he says that it was a war of aggression by NATO, even though Ukraine\u2019s not in NATO, and there are no NATO troops on Ukrainian soil and Ukraine itself of course did not start this war. So, he tells that story and a lot of people believe him or at least parts of it, at least the broader web of conspiracy that the Western world is always encroaching on Russia, and this is a reminder of what happened in the world wars and blah blah blah. So that\u2019s part of his strategy and he does get a fair amount of complicity from many Russians, but he knows not to push his luck.So, the second part of his strategy is to have most of the human toll that this war exacts on Russia as a society be exacted in those remote regions. Populations that are less well-informed, that are less positioned to object politically to Putin\u2019s rule or to people like prisoners who have nowhere else to go and aren\u2019t regarded well by the rest of society, that he\u2019ll disproportionately tap for his human wave attacks that they\u2019ve been employing so much, including recently in Avdiivka and other places where they\u2019ve had sometimes limited tactical success in the last couple of years, even though they haven\u2019t really netted any great territorial advantage for Russia. The war has been sort of stuck at Russia holding 18 percent of Ukraine for more than a year.So that\u2019s Putin\u2019s strategy. Tell a fairy tale about who caused the war and why they did so, and then keep the war out of the big cities and the elites. Don\u2019t have it affect them or their families so much. And I\u2019m afraid that strategy is working pretty well.PITA: Military and financial aid on the scale that Ukraine needs is of course going to require congressional authority from the U.S. However, if the Speaker of the House won\u2019t relent on bringing the current aid package to the floor, and if Republican members aren\u2019t willing to join Democrats in any sort of procedural maneuvers to force the bill to the floor without his approval, is there anything that the Biden administration can do, or maybe already is doing, that does not require congressional approval that will at least keep some small amount of aid and armaments continuing to Ukraine?O\u2019HANLON: Adrianna, it\u2019s a great question, and I wish I had a better answer for you in terms of an encouraging answer. Because at least Congress hasn\u2019t explicitly cut off aid in the sense of banning it. If Biden were to find some clever way to do what you\u2019re saying, it wouldn\u2019t be like the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, where Congress had said to the Reagan administration, thou shalt not give funds or weapons to the insurgents in Nicaragua. And then the Reagan administration went around them, went around Congress, broke the law, sold weapons to Iran to get cash, to then buy other weapons for the resistance in Nicaragua and just blatantly broke the law. In this case, if you could find some other source of money or weaponry that was sitting around, you might be able to tap into it. But we\u2019ve already more or less run out of that. Biden\u2019s made it clear, and I think rightly so, as president that he would only use official presidential drawdown authority to the extent authorized, and he would be very public about doing that, which means he could tap into American weapon stocks, but only to a certain extent. And Congress would have to effectively authorize even that. And Congress certainly would need to appropriate any money we would give directly to Ukraine, or any money we would use to replenish our own weapon stockpiles by buying more arms from defense industry. So, basically, it\u2019s all been done above the board and by the books, which is to the credit of President Biden and the right way to do it. But unfortunately, that means that when you run out of that explicit authority, you\u2019ve run out. And I suppose he could ask for private donations of money to Ukraine from American citizens. But in terms of selling weaponry, no, I don\u2019t know any other way to do it.PITA: All right, Mike, thank you very much for your time today. And again, I\u2019ll encourage our listeners to take a look for the full written debate and for the live discussion that you\u2019ll be taking part in.O\u2019HANLON: Well, thank you very much and also a big shout out to my colleagues and yours who have helped so much with this Ukraine Index project that we\u2019ve built and that has a lot of data on the Brookings website and also in yesterday\u2019s Washington Post under my byline. So, I got to enjoy the primary glory for the work, which was very good work, but it was your colleagues in Communications and mine in Foreign Policy who assembled and presented the data. So, it\u2019s been a nice team effort here at Brookings.PITA: Wonderful. Thanks very much, Mike.O\u2019HANLON: Thanks, Adrianna.\u00a0 More OnUkraineDefense & SecurityInternational Affairs      Sub-Topics    Diplomacy & Multilateralism U.S. Foreign Policy EuropeRussiaProgramForeign Policy RegionEurope Russia Ukraine CenterStrobe Talbott Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology Ukraine remains stronger than you might thinkUkraine        Ukraine remains stronger than you might think                    Michael E.

Attacks by Russian forces were reported in major cities across Ukraine, including Berdyansk, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, and the capital Kyiv. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) verified 10,582 deaths of civilians in Ukraine during the war as of February 2024. A separate page looks into the background of the conflict. The war resulted in a humanitarian crisis, as thousands of Ukrainians were internally displaced or fled abroad. Neighboring Poland recorded the highest number of border crossings from Ukraine, at around 17.3 million as of December 2023, followed by Hungary, Romania, and Russia.            How do Russian and Ukrainian militaries compare? \rRussia's active military personnel was over four times larger than Ukraine\u2019s as of 2023. Furthermore, Russia\u2019s total aircraft was 13 times, the number of armored vehicles four times, and the naval fleet 16 times larger than that of Ukraine. Russia had the fifth largest military spending in the world in 2021, at nearly 66 billion U.S. dollars. To compare, Ukraine expended almost six billion U.S. dollars. However, Ukraine has received military aid from Western countries, with the largest amount coming from the United States (U.S.)International reaction\rWestern countries, such as European Union (EU) members, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), and the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia. The restrictions targeted the financial sector, individuals affiliated with the government, and exports of high-tech products to Russia, among others. The EU also banned Russian airlines from its airspace, while Germany halted the certification of the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2. Albania, Australia, Canada, Japan, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan announced further sanctions. Major international companies, such as Apple, H&M, Ikea, Inditex, and McDonald's, suspended operations in Russia. While China and India took a neutral stance in the conflict, the governments of Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, Syria, and Venezuela officially supported Russia.Economic impact\rFollowing the invasion, the value of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar and euro dropped to a historic low. Central Bank interventions and the demand to pay for gas in Russian rubles have strengthened the currency. Following the restrictions on Russian fossil fuel imports into the U.S. and the EU, Russian fossil fuels exports shifted to Asian countries, making China the leading destination. Economies all over the world depended on Russia and Ukraine on the two countries' major export commodities, such as wheat. Furthermore, Russia exported the sixth-largest volume of aluminum and was the leading producer of palladium.                                This text provides general information.

Weapons from allies are running low. Pressure may build on Kyiv to seek a settlement, even from a weakened position.Share full article467Soldiers with the 31st Separate Mechanized Brigade firing a 122-millimeter howitzer D-30 at a Russian target this week in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesBy Steven Erlanger and David E. SangerReporting from Munich and BerlinFeb. 24, 2024Two years after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the United States has the capacity to keep Kyiv supplied with the weapons, technology and intelligence to fend off a takeover by Moscow. But Washington is now perceived around Europe to have lost its will.The Europeans, in contrast, have the will \u2014 they just committed another $54 billion to reconstruct the country \u2014 but when it comes to repelling Russia\u2019s revived offensive, they do not have the capacity.That is the essence of the conundrum facing Ukraine and the NATO allies on the dismal second anniversary of the war. It is a stunning reversal. Only a year ago, many here predicted that Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, bolstered by European tanks and missiles and American artillery and air defenses, could push the Russians back to where they were on Feb. 24, 2022.Now, some harsh lessons have emerged. The sanctions that were supposed to bring Russia\u2019s economy to its knees \u2014 \u201cthe ruble almost is immediately reduced to rubble,\u201d President Biden declared in Warsaw in March 2022 \u2014 have lost their sting. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s prediction that the Russian economy would shrink considerably was only briefly true; with the huge stimulus of military spending, it is growing faster than Germany\u2019s. Income from oil exports is greater than it was before the invasion.With the setbacks, and the failure of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, hope has just about collapsed that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will conclude anytime soon that he can make no further gains and should enter a serious negotiation to end the war.American and European intelligence officials now assess that Mr. Putin is determined to hold on, even at the cost of huge casualties, in the hope that a failure in Congress to fund Ukraine\u2019s effort sufficiently or a victory by former President Donald J. Trump in November will make up for the Russian leader\u2019s many early mistakes.ImageSoldiers who were recruited from across Russia at Kadyrov\u2019s Russian Special Forces University in December in Gudermes, Chechnya. Intelligence officials say there is little hope that Russia will enter a serious negotiation to end the war in Ukraine.Credit...Nanna Heitmann for The New York TimesBiden administration officials still insist that Mr. Putin has already suffered a \u201cstrategic defeat.\u201d His military is humiliated by its early failures and huge casualties, which Britain estimated on Saturday at 350,000 killed and wounded, and Russia can count on only China, Iran and North Korea as reliable suppliers.At the same time, NATO has enlarged. Sweden is set to become the 32nd member state within a few days, after the addition of Finland last year, and two-thirds of its members will each spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense this year, a significant increase.For the first time since NATO was founded in 1949, Europeans are finally taking seriously the need for a defense infrastructure independent of the United States.Still, as recent intelligence reports in Europe indicate that NATO nations might be Mr. Putin\u2019s target in the next three to five years, the question remains: Without a durable American commitment, can Ukraine and Europe defend against a new Russian threat?Strategic StalemateAt the core of the current strategic stalemate is the absence of any serious prospect of a negotiated settlement.As recently as last summer, senior members of the Biden administration held out hope that Ukrainian advances on the battlefield would force Mr. Putin to find a face-saving way out. The most commonly discussed possibility was a negotiated settlement that left unclear the future of the parts of Ukraine seized or annexed by Russia, but which would at least end the fighting.At the same time, at a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, Mr. Biden and his aides were discussing with President Volodymyr Zelensky putting together an \u201cIsrael model\u201d of aid for Ukraine. Even if short of actual membership, the plan aspired to provide a decade-long guarantee of the arms and training that Ukraine would need to keep Russia at bay.But even hope for those muddled outcomes has been cast aside amid the congressional debate over renewing short-term help for Ukraine, and as pessimism sets in that Ukraine can hold out long enough to think about the long term.As isolationism rises in a Republican-controlled Congress beholden to Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden has shifted from promising to give Ukraine \u201cwhatever it needs, for as long as it takes\u201d to last December\u2019s less ambitious \u201cas long as we can.\u201dImageFormerly Russian-held territory near Bakhmut.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesAt the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Senator J.D. Vance, Republican of Ohio, struck an even more sober note: Ukraine would have to learn how to fight on a tight budget.Even if the \u201c$61 billion of supplemental aid to Ukraine goes through, I have to be honest with you, that is not going to fundamentally change the reality on the battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of munitions that we can send to Ukraine right now is very limited.\u201dMr. Vance went on to make a second point: Those limited resources should be saved for competing with China and defending Taiwan.\u201cThere are a lot of bad guys all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m much more interested in some of the problems in East Asia right now than I am in Europe.\u201dMr. Vance\u2019s assessment was met with a stony silence. Shortly afterward, a senior American military official who declined to speak on the record said that the Republican debate in Washington and the mood among Ukraine\u2019s ground forces were reinforcing each other, \u201cand not in a positive way.\u201dIn the view of Charles A. Kupchan, a Georgetown University professor who served as a national security official in the Obama administration, that means the United States should be exploring ways to get negotiations started to end the war.\u201cEven if Russia can stay the course, I don\u2019t think Ukraine can,\u201d he said. After two years of war, Mr. Kupchan said, \u201cthere is no foreseeable pathway toward a battlefield victory for Ukraine,\u201d even with the imminent arrival of long-range missiles or F-16s.Mr. Zelensky faces a stark choice, he said: whether to keep every inch of sovereign Ukrainian territory, or find a way to secure an economically viable state, with a democratic future, Western security guarantees and eventual membership in the European Union and in NATO.In private, some senior Biden administration officials say they have been trying to nudge Mr. Zelensky in that direction. But Mr. Biden has instructed his staff not to deviate from the slogan it used at the beginning of the war: \u201cNothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\u201dImagePresident Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Washington in September.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesThe result is that American military officials in Europe, led by Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, have been quietly warning that the best the Ukrainians can hope for is a largely frozen conflict.General Cavoli rarely speaks publicly, but officials emerging from recent briefings with him described a downbeat assessment, one in which, at best, the Ukrainians use 2024 to defend, rebuild and attempt another counteroffensive next year.Even in Europe, where support for Ukraine has been strongest, public opinion is shifting, too. In a recent opinion poll conducted in January for the European Council on Foreign Relations in 12 countries, only 10 percent of Europeans said they believed Ukraine would win the war, though what would constitute a win was not clearly defined. Twenty percent said they believed that Russia would win, and a plurality, 37 percent, thought the war would end in some kind of settlement.But if the United States withdraws support from Ukraine and presses Kyiv for a deal, 41 percent of Europeans polled said their governments should either increase support to try to replace Washington or continue support at the current level. Roughly a third said that European countries should follow Washington and pressure Kyiv to settle.\u201cThings are not going well,\u201d Gabrielius Landsbergis, the foreign minister of Lithuania, said bluntly as he left the Munich Security Conference last week.\u201cUkraine is starved of ammunition and forced to pull back, Europe is facing challenges which might test Article 5, and global instability emerges because autocrats are emboldened by Russia\u2019s action and our cautious response,\u201d Mr. Landsbergis said on the social media platform X, in a reference to the section of the NATO treaty that calls for each member to come to the aid of any member under attack. \u201cThis is not pessimism. This is fact.\u201dAwakening to a Larger ThreatFor years, American officials have urged Europe to spend more on its defense. Now, Europeans are beginning to confront the cost of complacency.No matter who Americans elect as their next president in November, the United States may no longer be willing to take its traditional lead in deterring Russia or defending the West. That will inevitably place more of the burden on a Europe that is not yet fully prepared.Germany\u2019s military is better equipped, but it is not of the size or skill level needed to face the challenges ahead, its defense secretary, Boris Pistorius, has warned. Finland adds considerable technological capability to NATO, but Sweden\u2019s military, American officials say, will need to be rebuilt.ImageA Leopard 2 tank, front, at the factory of the German weapons manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann in 2022 in Munich.Credit...Felix Schmitt for The New York TimesMeanwhile, Europe is piecing together packages of help for Ukraine that were first meant to supplement, but now may be intended to replace, aid from the United States.This month, European Union leaders pledged another 50 billion euros, about $54 billion, in new aid to Ukraine over the next four years. In aggregate, European countries have outpaced the United States in aid provided to Ukraine.To date, said Victoria Nuland, the under secretary of state for political affairs, the United States has provided $75 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian assistance. But, she said, \u201cEurope and our global partners have provided even more, $107 billion, in addition to hosting 4.5 million Ukrainian refugees in countries across Europe.\u201dYet to fully replace American military assistance this year, according to an assessment by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Europe would still have \u201cto double its current level and pace of arms assistance.\u201dAnd European efforts to provide another 5 billion euros, about $5.4 billion, over each of the next four years to buy arms for Ukraine have stalled because of objections by Germany and France.The Germans say they are paying too much into the fund, given their large bilateral funding of aid to Ukraine, the second largest in the world after the United States.The French are, as ever, insisting that weapons purchased with European money should be made or at least partly made in Europe \u2014 though Europe doesn\u2019t have the capacity to provide them.And European promises to deliver one million artillery shells to Ukraine by March have fallen well short.Still, European arms production has been increasing, with senior European officials saying that the continent should be able to produce a million shells a year by the end of this year, compared with about 350,000 shells 18 months ago.While Europeans point proudly to the changes they have made, it remains far from certain that those changes are happening as fast as the world demands, especially when it comes to Ukraine.\u201cStrategically the goal should be to change Putin\u2019s calculations,\u201d said Mr. Kupchan, the former Obama administration official. \u201cDisrupt the field. I know it\u2019s not easy, but it is better to admit mistakes and chart a new path forward rather than to engage in empty self-congratulation.\u201dImageShells and primers are seen inside a self-propelled howitzer as the 80th Brigade waited to fire artillery toward Russian positions last year near Kreminna, Ukraine.Credit...Nicole Tung for The New York TimesSteven Erlanger is the chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe and is based in Berlin.

Marko Djurica/ReutersArticleCurrent political and economic issues succinctly explained.Every year, the United States sends billions of dollars in aid\u2014and much more than any other country\u2014to beneficiaries around the world in pursuit of its security, economic, and humanitarian interests.\u00a0Since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has become far and away the top recipient of U.S. foreign aid. This marks the first time that a European country has held the top spot since the Harry S. Truman administration directed vast sums into rebuilding the continent through the Marshall Plan after World War II.More on:UkraineForeign AidUnited StatesMilitary OperationsThe Joe Biden administration and the U.S. Congress have directed about $75 billion in assistance to Ukraine, which includes humanitarian, financial, and military support, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research institute. (This figure does not include all war-related U.S. spending, such as aid to allies.) The historic sums are helping a broad set of Ukrainian people and institutions, including refugees, law enforcement, and independent radio broadcasters, though most of the aid has been military-related. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), are also providing large aid packages to Ukraine.However, the flow of U.S. aid to Ukraine looked uncertain in early 2024 as new funding legislation remained stalled in Congress. Meanwhile, EU leaders have agreed to provide Ukraine another 50 billion euros in multiyear financial support after overcoming opposition from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.Much of the aid has gone toward providing weapons systems, training, and intelligence that Ukrainian commanders need to defend against Russia, which has one of the world\u2019s most powerful militaries. Many Western analysts say the military aid provided by the United States and other allies has played a pivotal role in Ukraine\u2019s defense and counteroffensive against Russia. U.S. and allied leaders consider Russia\u2019s invasion a brutal and illegal war of aggression on NATO\u2019s frontier that, if successful, would subjugate millions of Ukrainians; encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s revanchist aims; and invite similar aggression from other rival powers, especially China.Get the FactsHow Much Aid Has the U.S. Sent Israel?NATO allies are particularly wary of being pulled directly into the hostilities, which could dramatically raise the risk of a nuclear war. However, as the fighting has progressed, many donor governments have shed their reluctance to give Ukraine more sophisticated assets, such as battle tanks and modern fighter aircraft. In the summer of 2023, the United States agreed to allow its European allies to provide Ukraine with U.S.-made F-16s. The first transfer of these advanced fighters was expected in mid-2024, around the time the first set of Ukrainian pilots were scheduled to complete their training on the aircraft.Two years into the war, the Biden administration had provided or agreed to provide Ukraine with a long list of defense capabilities, including Abrams battle tanks, anti-aircraft missiles, coastal defense ships, and advanced surveillance and radar systems. In July 2023, the Biden administration sparked some controversy in agreeing to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions, which are banned by most countries because of the risk their undetonated components can pose to civilians many years after their use.More on:UkraineForeign AidUnited StatesMilitary OperationsWhen compared with U.S. assistance to other top recipients, both in recent years and in decades past, the extraordinary scale of this aid comes into view.\u00a0However, the magnitude of U.S. aid to Ukraine might seem less remarkable in comparison to what the Pentagon is budgeted each year, or what the Treasury was authorized (via the Troubled Asset Relief Fund) to bail out Wall Street banks, auto companies, and other sectors of the economy during the U.S. financial crisis.When compared with the critical support to Ukraine from other countries, the size of U.S. aid stands out.\u00a0However, many European governments are making larger financial contributions to Ukraine relative to the size of their economies.Megan Fahrney contributed research to this article.Creative Commons      Creative Commons: Some rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov)   For the past two years, nearly every reference in the US media to the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia has been preceded by an obligatory word\u2014\u201cunprovoked.\u201dThe public was told that this was a war without cause, that Ukraine was blameless, and that the invasion was to be explained entirely in terms of the intentions and psychology of one man, Russian President Vladimir Putin.However, on the weekend of the second anniversary of the war, the New York Times published a lengthy article revealing that the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 was instigated by a systematic and widespread campaign of military-intelligence aggression on the part of the United States.The article details longstanding Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  operations in Ukraine, in which the agency sponsored and built up the Ukrainian military intelligence agency HUR, using it as a weapon of spying, assassination and provocation directed against Russia for more than a decade.The\u00a0Times\u00a0writes:Toward the end of 2021, according to a senior European official, Mr. Putin was weighing whether to launch his full-scale invasion when he met with the head of one of Russia\u2019s main spy services, who told him that the C.I.A., together with Britain\u2019s MI6, were controlling Ukraine and turning it into a beachhead for operations against Moscow.The\u00a0Times\u00a0report demonstrates that this Russian intelligence assessment was absolutely true. For more than a decade, dating back to 2014, the CIA was building up, training and arming Ukrainian intelligence and paramilitary forces that were engaging in assassinations and other provocations against pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, against Russian forces in Crimea and across the border into Russia itself.In a critical passage, the Times writes:As the partnership deepened after 2016, the Ukrainians became impatient with what they considered Washington\u2019s undue caution, and began staging assassinations and other lethal operations, which violated the terms the White House thought the Ukrainians had agreed to. Infuriated, officials in Washington threatened to cut off support, but they never did.In other words, Ukrainian paramilitary forces that were armed, funded and led by the United States and NATO were systematically assassinating forces supporting closer relations with Russia.The newspaper\u2019s account begins with the Maidan Coup of February 2014, when right-wing and neo-Nazi forces backed by the US and the European Union overthrew the elected pro-Russian president and installed a pro-imperialist regime headed by the billionaire Petro Poroshenko.The SEP launches its campaign for a socialist alternative in 2024 to Biden and Trump, the corporate candidates of war and dictatorship!David North, the national chairman of the Socialist Equality Party (US) announced today the selection of Joe Kishore and Jerry White as its candidates in the 2024 presidential election campaign.This coup was the culmination of two decades of imperialist inroads into the former Soviet bloc, including the expansion of NATO to include virtually all of Eastern Europe in violation of pledges made to the leaders of the former Soviet Union. The\u00a0Times\u00a0is silent on this earlier history, as well as on the role of the CIA in the Maidan events.Maidan set the stage for a massive escalation of the CIA intervention, as detailed in the\u00a0Times\u00a0report. The intelligence agency played a central role in fueling conflict between Ukraine and Russia, first as a low-level war against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, then as a full-scale war after the Russian invasion in February 2022. Three US administrations were involved: first Obama, then Trump and now Biden.According to the\u00a0Times\u00a0account, CIA operations included not only widespread spying, but also assisting direct provocations such as the assassination of pro-Russian politicians in eastern Ukraine and paramilitary attacks on Russian forces in Crimea.The\u00a0Times\u00a0reports that a Ukrainian unit, the Fifth Directorate, was tasked with conducting assassinations, including one in 2016. The\u00a0Times\u00a0writes:[A] mysterious explosion in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, ripped through an elevator carrying a senior Russian separatist commander named Arsen Pavlov, known by his nom de guerre, Motorola.The C.I.A. soon learned that the assassins were members of the Fifth Directorate, the spy group that received C.I.A. training. Ukraine\u2019s domestic intelligence agency had even handed out commemorative patches to those involved, each one stitched with the word \u201cLift,\u201d the British term for an elevator.The report describes another such operation:A team of Ukrainian agents set up an unmanned, shoulder-fired rocket launcher in a building in the occupied territories. It was directly across from the office of a rebel commander named Mikhail Tolstykh, better known as Givi. Using a remote trigger, they fired the launcher as soon as Givi entered his office, killing him, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials.Since the outbreak of full-scale war, the Ukrainian HUR has extended these assassination operations to the whole territory of Russia, including the killing of Darya Dugina, a leading pro-Putin polemicist in the Russian media, and Russian government and military officials.The CIA found its Ukrainian allies very useful in collecting vast amounts of data on Russian military and intelligence activity, so much that the HUR itself could not process it and had to forward the raw data to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia for analysis. An earlier, less detailed report on this intelligence collaboration, in the\u00a0Washington Post, cited a Ukrainian intelligence official\u2019s estimate that \u201c250,000 to 300,000\u201d Russian military/intelligence messages were being collected each day. This data was not just related to Ukraine, but concerned Russian intelligence activity all over the world.Long before the Russian invasion, the CIA was seeking to broaden its attack on Moscow. The\u00a0Times\u00a0reports:The relationship [with the Ukrainian HUR] was so successful that the C.I.A. wanted to replicate it with other European intelligence services that shared a focus in countering Russia.The head of Russia House, the C.I.A. department overseeing operations against Russia, organized a secret meeting at The Hague. There, representatives from the C.I.A., Britain\u2019s MI6, the HUR, the Dutch service (a critical intelligence ally) and other agencies agreed to start pooling together more of their intelligence on Russia.The result was a secret coalition against Russia\u2014and the Ukrainians were vital members of it.All these activities occurred well before the Russian invasion of February 2022. The outbreak of full-scale war led to even more direct CIA engagement in Ukraine. CIA agents were the only Americans not covered by the initial evacuation of US government personnel from Ukraine, removing only to western Ukraine. They continually briefed the Ukrainians on Russian military plans, including precise details of operations as they were unfolding.According to the\u00a0Times:Within weeks, the C.I.A. had returned to Kyiv, and the agency sent in scores of new officers to help the Ukrainians. A senior U.S. official said of the C.I.A.\u2019s sizable presence, \u201cAre they pulling triggers? No. Are they helping with targeting? Absolutely.\u201dSome of the C.I.A. officers were deployed to Ukrainian bases. They reviewed lists of potential Russian targets that the Ukrainians were preparing to strike, comparing the information that the Ukrainians had with U.S. intelligence to ensure that it was accurate.In other words, the CIA was helping direct the war, making the US government a full participant, a co-belligerent in a war with nuclear-armed Russia, despite Biden\u2019s claim that the United States was only aiding Ukraine from afar. And all this without the American people having the slightest say in the matter.The\u00a0Times\u00a0account also provides an inadvertent indictment of the American media. The newspaper writes:The details of this intelligence partnership, many of which are being disclosed by the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0for the first time, have been a closely guarded secret for a decade.This admission means that these secrets were \u201cclosely guarded\u201d by the\u00a0Times itself. As former Editor Bill Keller once observed, freedom of the press means freedom\u00a0not\u00a0to publish, and \u201cthat is a freedom we exercise with some regularity.\u201d Particularly, we might add, when it comes to the crimes of US imperialism.The\u00a0Times\u00a0article is not so much an exposure as a controlled release of information. The US \u201cnewspaper of record\u201d reports that the two authors of the piece, Adam Entous\u00a0and\u00a0Michael Schwirtz, conducted \u201cmore than 200 interviews\u201d with \u201ccurrent and former officials in Ukraine, elsewhere in Europe, and in the United States.\u201d This activity could hardly have taken place without the knowledge, permission, even encouragement of the CIA, as well as the Zelensky regime and Ukrainian intelligence.In the meantime, a real journalist, Julian Assange, is awaiting the decision on his final appeal against extradition to the United States, where he faces 175 years in prison or even a death sentence. The crime of Assange and WikiLeaks, which Assange founded, is that they did not obey the rules of bourgeois journalism and did not seek the permission of the military-intelligence authorities before publishing revelations about US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, the efforts of the US State Department to subvert and manipulate governments, and the spying activities of the CIA and National Security Agency.The exposure of a decade of CIA operations in Ukraine\u2014clearly at the request of the agency itself\u2014appears to be linked to the ongoing conflict within the US ruling elite over what policy to adopt in that war, in the wake of the debacle suffered by the Zelensky regime in last year\u2019s offensive, which gained little and suffered colossal casualties. Congressional Republicans have blocked further military and financial aid to Ukraine, effectively declaring that the US must cut its losses there and concentrate on the main enemy, China.By reporting the virtual control of the Ukrainian regime by the US military-intelligence apparatus, the\u00a0Times\u00a0is seeking to pressure the Republicans to support the war funding. It is arguing that this money is not going to a foreign government, in a foreign war, thousands of miles from US borders, but to a subcontractor of American imperialism, waging an American war in which US personnel are deeply and directly engaged.In so doing, the Times has revealed its own coverage of the Ukraine war over the past two years to have been nothing more than war propaganda, aimed at using a fraudulent narrative to dragoon the American public to support a predatory imperialist war of aggression aimed at subjugating and dismantling Russia.Join the fight for socialismRead moreIn bipartisan vote, US Senate backs $95 billion for war in Ukraine, genocide in Gaza14 February 2024Two years of the US-NATO war against Russia in Ukraine24 February 2024Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:PerspectivesLoading\u00a9 1998-2024 World Socialist Web Site.

NICOLAS ECONOMOU / NURPHOTO/ AFP   With each crisis, Europe shows its faults, and the war in Ukraine is no exception. Two years after Russia invaded the country, European states managed to stay united in sanctioning Moscow and supporting Kyiv on military, humanitarian, economic and political levels. However, this cohesive action could be severely tested if Donald Trump returns to the White House following the November presidential election, which would mean the US's level of solidarity is reduced. A discreet but very real divide has opened up over the months: The northeastern part of the continent is on a war footing, on the front lines against the Russian threat, while further west and south other countries have taken a less existential view of the conflict. A poll carried out in 12 EU countries by the think tank European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), published on Wednesday, February 21, shows that the differences are not due to predictions about the conflict's outcome. On average, only 10% of Europeans believe in a victory for Kyiv, compared with 20% for Moscow (a relative majority anticipate some form of compromise), with little variation between countries. However, this does not prevent half of the people in Sweden, Poland and Portugal from advocating support for Ukraine in reclaiming its territories currently under Russian occupation. Conversely, half or more of Hungarians, Greeks, Italians, Romanians and Austrians want to push Kyiv to negotiate with Moscow. The French, Spanish, Dutch and Germans are more divided.    The various governments' policies have reflected these nuances. In the Baltic States particularly, mobilization remains strong. \"We've been saying Russia is a threat for decades,\" explained Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur. On January 19, his country, along with Latvia and Lithuania, signed an agreement outlining the establishment of a defense line along their eastern border. It will be constructed starting from 2025 and will consist of 600 underground bunkers, barbed wire and other \"anti-mobility\" installations intended to slow the advance of Russian troops in the event of an offensive. \"It's not a Maginot Line, but facilities that will be placed near the border in peacetime, and will allow us to gain time if we ever have to face the worst,\" explained Pevkur.

However, little is known about the psychological states surrounding the outbreak of war, particularly the mental well-being of individuals outside Ukraine. Here, we present a longitudinal experience-sampling study of a convenience sample from 17 European countries (total participants = 1,341, total assessments = 44,894, countries with >100 participants = 5) that allows us to track well-being levels across countries during the weeks surrounding the outbreak of war. Our data show a significant decline in well-being on the day of the Russian invasion. Recovery over the following weeks was associated with an individual\u2019s personality but was not statistically significantly associated with their age, gender, subjective social status, and political orientation. In general, well-being was lower on days when the war was more salient on social media. Our results demonstrate the need to consider the psychological implications of the Russo-Ukrainian war next to its humanitarian, economic, and ecological consequences.Similar content being viewed by othersOnline images amplify gender biasArticleOpen access14 February 2024Douglas Guilbeault, Sol\u00e8ne Delecourt, \u2026 Ethan NadlerGlobally representative evidence on the actual and perceived support for climate actionArticleOpen access09 February 2024Peter Andre, Teodora Boneva, \u2026 Armin FalkMicrodosing with psilocybin mushrooms: a double-blind placebo-controlled studyArticleOpen access02 August 2022Federico Cavanna, Stephanie Muller, \u2026 Enzo TagliazucchiIntroductionOn February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, thereby violating the country\u2019s territorial sovereignty and escalating the Russo-Ukrainian war that began in 20141,2. Besides devastating effects on the Ukrainian population, the invasion has had severe global consequences; for example, the war has resulted in Europe\u2019s fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II, global food shortages, and negative effects on the world economy3,4,5,6,7. The UN Global Crisis Response Group estimates that 1.6 billion people in 94 countries are exposed to at least one dimension of the crisis8. While effects such as the displacement of millions of civilians or disrupted supply chains are immediately visible, the psychological implications of the outbreak of war may be more difficult to trace, with potentially even more people worldwide experiencing psychological distress and impaired mental health during the war. Here, we used international, longitudinal data from January to April 2022, to investigate (a) the development of individuals\u2019 well-being during the weeks surrounding the outbreak of war, (b) potential explanations for individual differences in reactions to the event, and (c) the correspondence between daily well-being and the daily salience of the war on social media during this period.When investigating the psychological effect of major life events such as an outbreak of war, researchers often face the problem that people volunteer for studies only after experiencing the event. Besides potentially introducing retrospective biases, such cross-sectional data do not allow for investigations of pre-post comparisons or change over time, such as anticipation or recovery effects9,10. Panel studies that track participants across time circumvent these limitations, but they often have a low time resolution with only one or a few assessments per year, and they are typically undertaken in a single country at a time. These limitations make it difficult to study events that presumably have their most direct psychological effects right when they happen and that affect individuals across nations (e.g., the outbreak of a war). Here, we present a study that allowed us to address these challenges. From October 12, 2021, to August 16, 2022, we conducted a global experience-sampling study in more than 40 countries as part of the \u201cCoping with Corona\u201d project (CoCo)11. Over a 4-week experience-sampling data collection period, participants reported their well-being in four randomly timed brief assessments per day, allowing us to track their momentary well-being. Additionally, participants completed online surveys on personality and sociodemographic variables before and after the experience-sampling period. These data offer a unique opportunity to trace well-being levels surrounding the outbreak of war in Ukraine over time and across countries.In our preregistered analyses (osf.io/3uqtf), we focused on European countries because the outbreak of war has had the most direct consequences and was likely to be monitored most closely by the public in these countries12. Furthermore, to focus on the period during which the most important developments (to date) in the Russo-Ukrainian war took place, we targeted a two-month time window around the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The final European sample of N\u2009=\u20091,341 participants (44,894 experience-sampling reports) is illustrated in Fig.\u00a01. Detailed, country-specific descriptive statistics are presented in Supplementary Table\u00a01. All analyses were extended to and compared with all non-European countries in our sample as well as with broader and narrower time frames. In addition, we conducted several supplementary and robustness analyses (e.g., to investigate whether the results generalize to societal well-being and to control for country effects), the results of which are presented in the supplement.Fig. 1: Number of experience-sampling measurements in European countries between January 24\u00a0and March 27,\u00a02022.The number of measurements per country is indicated by the respective colour.Full size imageBased on these analyses, we report an acute decline in global well-being levels on the day of the Russian invasion that affected individuals across nations and was not statistically significantly associated with their age, gender, social status, political orientation, or personality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that recovery in well-being over the weeks following the outbreak of war was slow and associated with an individual\u2019s personality, with individuals low in trait Stability showing close to no recovery effects, on average. Lastly, we show that well-being was particularly low on days when the war was more salient on social media.ResultsWell-being development surrounding the outbreak of warTo determine how individuals\u2019 well-being changed over the weeks before the Russians invaded Ukraine, on the day of the invasion, and in the weeks that followed, we adopted statistical procedures established in the literature on the psychological effect of personal life events13,14. That is, we fit eight multilevel models to the data, each representing different potential trajectories of well-being over time (Fig.\u00a02). We then compared the model fits to identify the model that best approximated the change in well-being around the outbreak of the war. The coefficients of all models are presented in the supplement (Supplementary Table\u00a02). The best-fitting model was Model 2d, which is characterized by independent linear trends leading up to and following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a sudden baseline level change on the day of the invasion.Fig. 2: Illustration of the eight models representing different theoretically possible trajectories of well-being over time.The x-axes represent time; the y-axes represent mean daily well-being. The vertical dashed lines represent the day of the Russian invasion. The statistical operationalization of each model is presented in Table\u00a03. Model 2d is highlighted because it fit the data best and was thus used for interpretation.Full size imageThe upper left quarter of Table\u00a01 displays the fixed-effects coefficients of Model 2d. In addition, Fig.\u00a03 displays the fixed and random slopes of Model 2d in our sample. The solid blue line illustrates the change in mean well-being as predicted by the model. The linear slope of well-being leading up to the Russian invasion was close to zero and not statistically significant (b\u2009=\u20090.005, 95% CI [\u22120.097, 0.107], p\u2009=\u20090.923). Thus, we found no credible evidence that participants experienced positive or negative anticipation effects in the weeks before the outbreak of the war, on average. On the day of the invasion, there was a sudden and significant decline in well-being (b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.200, 95% CI [\u22120.278, \u22120.122], p\u2009<\u20090.001), indicating that participants experienced an abrupt worsening of their well-being on that day, on average. In the following weeks, the linear slope was small but positive (b\u2009=\u20090.089, 95% CI [\u22120.006, 0.184], p\u2009=\u20090.066). Even though this increase was nonsignificant at p\u2009<\u20090.05, the effect size of the regression coefficient suggested that it took individuals approximately two months after the invasion to recover their initial well-being levels, on average. While this interpretation needs to be confirmed in future studies, it is in line with supplementary analyses considering narrower and broader time frames, in which the post-event slope was significant and positive (Supplementary Tables\u00a011 and 13). Regarding country differences, we found some evidence of mean-level differences between countries and country-specific recovery effects that we discuss below (Supplementary Tables\u00a05 and 7). Supplementary analyses on the data from our global sample yielded comparable results (Supplementary Table\u00a09) and revealed that participants from European countries had significantly lower well-being compared with participants from non-European countries during the period surrounding the outbreak of the war (b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.245, 95% CI [\u22120.329, \u22120.162], p\u2009<\u20090.001).Table 1 Predicting well-being by time variables, personality, and the salience of the warFull size tableFig. 3: Slopes of individual and mean well-being over time as predicted by Model 2d.The solid blue line illustrates the predicted mean well-being trajectories. The thin gray lines represent the predicted well-being trajectories of 100 randomly chosen participants. The two dashed lines represent the predicted well-being trajectories of individuals with Stability scores of one standard deviation above (upper line; +1\u2009SD) and below the mean (lower line, -1SD).Full size imageDifferences in reactions to the warThe thin gray lines in Fig.\u00a03 represent the well-being trajectories of 100 randomly selected participants as predicted by Model 2d. Participants differed considerably in their individual slopes, especially in the weeks following the Russian invasion. To partly explain these individual differences in people\u2019s reactions to the outbreak of the war, we included the personality meta-trait Stability as a predictor of the individual slopes in Model 2d. Stability is a broad personality trait that reflects differences between people in how agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable they are15,16. Stability has been both theoretically17 and empirically18 linked to various aspects of well-being. Therefore, individual differences in Stability may help explain different reactions to the war. In supplementary analyses, we considered additional personality traits as well (i.e., the meta-trait Plasticity and the Big Five domains, Supplementary Tables\u00a017 and 18). In addition to personality, we investigated several sociodemographic variables (age, gender, subjective social status, political orientation) as potential predictors of the individual changes in well-being in Model 2d (Supplementary Table\u00a03).The two dashed lines in Fig.\u00a03 represent the predicted changes in well-being in individuals whose Stability is one standard deviation above (upper line) or below (lower line) the sample mean. In addition, the results of Model 2d including Stability as a moderator are presented in the upper right quadrant of Table\u00a01. Individuals high in Stability had an overall higher well-being compared with individuals low in Stability (b\u2009=\u20090.245, 95% CI [0.180, 0.311], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Stability was not statistically significantly associated with changes in well-being in the weeks leading up to and on the day of the Russian invasion (b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.043, 95% CI [\u22120.139, 0.054], p\u2009=\u20090.386 and b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.027, 95% CI [\u22120.102, 0.048], p\u2009=\u20090.485, respectively). However, it was significantly associated with recovery in well-being in the weeks after the invasion (b\u2009=\u20090.161, 95% CI [0.066, 0.255], p\u2009=\u20090.001). That is, while individuals high in Stability tended to recover comparatively quickly from the decline in well-being, individuals low in Stability tended to show close to no recovery effects in the first month after the invasion. We found some indication of country-specific effects of Stability on recovery, which we discuss below (Supplementary Tables\u00a05 and 8). Compared with the sociodemographic variables, personality was more strongly associated with well-being, and it was the only predictor that significantly explained variability in changes in well-being after the Russian invasion (Supplementary Table\u00a03).Effect of the salience of the warLastly, we investigated whether daily well-being corresponded to the daily salience of the war. One potential path through which the outbreak of war may have influenced well-being is in the extent to which individuals were confronted with the war and thereby started ruminating about the humanitarian catastrophes or the dangerous implications for themselves. To investigate this possibility, we retrieved the daily number of tweets that contained the keyword \u201cUkraine\u201d worldwide and used this as a sample-independent indicator of the daily salience of the war on social media. Figure\u00a04 depicts the mean daily well-being score in our sample and the number of Ukraine-related tweets each day worldwide. Both indicators showed related developments over the weeks that corresponded to the development of the war. For example, the decline in well-being on the day of the Russian invasion coincided with an increase in Ukraine-related tweets that slowly subsided over the following weeks.Fig. 4: Major events of the Russo-Ukrainian war and corresponding well-being levels and Ukraine-related tweets.The solid blue line illustrates the mean daily well-being scores across participants (standardized across state measurements) and corresponds to the scale on the left. The dashed green line illustrates the number of Ukraine-related tweets each day (standardized across days) and corresponds to the scale on the right. The vertical dashed lines mark a selection of psychologically relevant events during the investigation period.Full size imageIn line with this visual observation, multilevel models (see the lower quadrants of Table\u00a01) revealed that the number of Ukraine-related tweets were significantly negatively associated with daily well-being (b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.070, 95% CI [\u22120.096, \u22120.044], p\u2009<\u20090.001). We found a significant association with the between-subjects component (i.e., the average salience per person across all days on which they participated; b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.116, 95% CI [\u22120.207, \u22120.024], p\u2009=\u20090.013) and the within-subjects component of the salience (i.e., the daily deviation between salience on that day and the corresponding person\u2019s average salience; b\u2009=\u2009\u22120.065, 95% CI [\u22120.092, \u22120.037], p\u2009<\u20090.001). This finding indicates that individuals who participated on days with more Ukraine-related tweets had lower average well-being and that participants had lower average well-being on the days in their sampling period with more Ukraine-related tweets. Comparable associations were found for lagged associations (i.e., when predicting well-being from the number of Ukraine-related tweets from the previous day, Supplementary Table\u00a015). We found no credible evidence that these effects were associated with individuals\u2019 personalities and sociodemographic characteristics (Supplementary Table\u00a04).DiscussionHere, we used international, longitudinal experience-sampling data to track well-being levels across countries during the weeks surrounding the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Multilevel analyses revealed that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was associated with an acute decline in participants\u2019 well-being in our sample. While we found no credible evidence that this initial decline in well-being was related to individuals\u2019 personality traits or their sociodemographic characteristics, there were systematic differences in how quickly individuals\u2019 well-being recovered from the initial decline. Specifically, the well-being of individuals high in the personality meta-trait Stability recovered more quickly than that of individuals low in Stability.The fact that we found statistically significant associations between personality and recovery in well-being after the war but no credible evidence for associations between personality and the amplitude of the initial decline on the day of the Russian invasion might be explained by the high situational strength:19 Waking up to smartphone notifications saying that the biggest country in the world had invaded a European country might have shocked people in similar ways, independent of their personalities or sociodemographic attributes. In the weeks that followed, when the initial shock had subsided, the situation had a potentially less uniform effect on individuals, such that differences in threat sensitivity, tendency to ruminate, and other traits covered by Stability might have led to differences in participants\u2019 propensities to experience a quick recovery in their well-being.In general, individuals who participated on days when the war was especially salient on social media reported lower average well-being, and individuals reported lower average well-being on days when the war was more salient on social media. There is most likely a reciprocal relationship between daily well-being and salience, such that individuals worldwide posted more war-related tweets on days when they were particularly distressed by it, and individuals became more distressed by being exposed to war-related content on social media and elsewhere.Over the weeks following the Russian invasion, when the war did not escalate to include further countries and its salience on social media decreased, participants tended to experience a recovery in their well-being, even though this recovery was slow and associated with participants\u2019 personality traits. This finding is in line with set-point models of well-being9,20, which assert that good and bad events temporarily affect happiness, but that people quickly adapt back to their initial baseline level of well-being (a phenomenon that psychologists have referred to as the hedonic treadmill21). While this phenomenon was initially described as universal to human experience, more recent work has demonstrated that well-being set points can change under some conditions and that individuals differ in their adaptation to events20,22. Our results provide further support for these revisions to the hedonic treadmill model, as we found a normative adaption in well-being levels to the outbreak of war, on average, but substantial individual differences in such recovery effects that were related to personality traits.Because the decline in well-being was only temporary for most participants, one might ask whether this reaction should be interpreted as a sign of dysfunctional distress or whether it could also be regarded as a natural or even adaptive response to the outbreak of war. For instance, such negative emotions might be one of the driving forces behind the overwhelming support for Ukraine (e.g., as expressed in donations or public peace demonstrations). Accordingly, it could be argued that trying to mitigate the negative effects on well-being with psychological interventions might reduce the support for Ukraine. Thus, to better understand the adaptiveness of the changes in well-being in response to the war, we conducted post-hoc (i.e., non-preregistered) supplementary analyses relating participants\u2019 well-being levels to various self-indicated Ukraine-related behaviors, emotions, and evaluations, as well as to different coping styles (Supplementary Table\u00a021). In these exploratory analyses, we found that lowered well-being levels were mainly related to dysfunctional psychological indicators in our sample (e.g., worries about one\u2019s psychological health, anticipation of a third world war, avoidant coping strategies). We also found some associations between lower well-being and prosocial indicators such as stronger empathy with the affected people in the war zone, but we found no credible evidence that these translated to an increased solidarity with Ukraine (e.g., expressed through donations or participation in public protests). However, these post-hoc analyses are exploratory in nature. Future studies should examine more thoroughly how much lowered well-being in response to major societal crises includes maladaptive (e.g., overwhelming distress, worsening of clinical symptoms such as panic attacks, functional limitations such as disrupted sleep) and adaptive components (e.g., an expression of empathy and values such as peace and human rights).Given that lowered well-being as a response to major societal crises is likely associated with dysfunctional stress at least for some individuals, it is warranted to consider ways to support individuals in coping with such crises. Rather than applying large-scale, expensive interventions for the whole population (which seems unrealistic given the many challenges arising after an event like the outbreak of war), institutions could focus on mental health campaigns that can be mobilized in a cost-effective and quick manner and that target those individuals who need them. For example, while increasing clinical capacities to supply individual psychotherapy to everyone in need will most likely not be possible, ad-hoc group therapy sessions, telephone helpline support, or web-based clinical interventions are relatively inexpensive yet still effective alternatives that could be rolled out in a timely manner23,24,25,26. Another option would be to promote and inform about self-administered interventions that affected individuals could apply when they feel particularly distressed. For example, expressive writing27 is a self-directed exercise in which one writes down all thoughts and feelings of currently stressful events. This method, which takes no more than 20\u201330\u2009min, has been demonstrated to increase well-being and decrease anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms28,29. However, we must note that we have not tested these direct implications for policy or clinical practice here, and the interventions mentioned are raised only as potential future implications. In addition, when administering or promoting such psychological interventions, it will always be important to consider the specific contexts and characteristics of the individuals, as well as the severity of their psychopathological symptoms. In particular, individuals who suffer from severe psychopathology following a major societal crisis (such as post-traumatic stress disorder) may require more intensive interventions such as individual psychotherapy. Indiscriminately applying solutions developed for more transient stress symptoms in these more severe cases might turn out to be ineffective or even detrimental to fostering psychological health30.Even though we cannot make strong direct causal inferences based on the data considered here, the outbreak of the war offers the most parsimonious explanation for the acute dip in well-being on the day of the Russian invasion and the associations found with the salience of the war on social media. Still, some limitations of our study should be noted. First, while our dataset includes many countries worldwide, participants are not equally distributed across these countries, with some countries (e.g., Italy, Germany) being overly represented and other countries contributing only a few participants. This imbalance makes it difficult to derive conclusions about the effects in single countries and the degree to which our results generalize to all countries in the world. Also, one needs to consider the unequal distribution of our data across time within these countries, as the number of daily reports peaked before the outbreak of war in some countries (e.g., Germany, UK) but during the weeks after the event in others (e.g., France, Italy). Robustness analyses accounting for mean-level differences between countries yielded no credible evidence that these differences affect the results in general. However, in exploratory supplementary analyses (not preregistered), we found some evidence for country-specific well-being trajectories. For instance, we found stronger recovery effects that were less strongly related to Stability when excluding Italy or weaker recovery effects that were more strongly related to Stability when excluding Turkey from the analyses. These findings suggest that the psychological effects of the outbreak of war in Ukraine might have differed between countries (e.g., due to their proximity to Ukraine or prior existing political tensions), but these differences are difficult to disentangle with our data. Future studies might combine separate datasets across countries collected during the weeks of the Russian invasion to circumvent the problem of unbalanced data distribution across countries and time. Second, our data were skewed towards more female, educated, and younger participants. This limits their representativeness for the general population, and future studies should investigate whether the effects of the outbreak of war change when including a more diverse and representative sample. Lastly, our sample did not include Ukrainian or Russian individuals for whom the psychological implications of the war have most likely been much larger. For example, Cheung and colleagues31 found that the war in Syria had a devastating effect on the Syrian population\u2019s well-being with a magnitude of 1.1\u2009SD. Even though it might be difficult to get reliable data from Ukraine and Russia regarding the mental health and well-being of their people, researchers should strive to uncover the psychological implications of the outbreak of war for these key populations.Despite these limitations, we found evidence that the well-being of the European population temporarily declined after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. How large was the effect size of the decline? Compared with effect sizes found for other tragic life events, such as bereavement or disability (drops of around 0.6 to 0.7\u2009SD)9,32, we found a rather small effect size (0.2\u2009SD). However, the previous studies investigated narrow subgroups of the population (e.g., disabled or bereaved people) and comparatively personal rather than collective life events. Considering that we investigated the decline in well-being in a broad sample following a global crisis, the effect size we found is considerably larger than in other studies of population-level global events, such as the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns (no significant effects)33 or the 2011 Fukushima disaster (drop in life satisfaction of around 0.12\u2009SD for residents in the affected areas)34. As such, an important avenue for future research will be to identify relevant characteristics of life events that cause changes in well-being and to identify relevant characteristics of individuals who react resiliently to these events35.Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, governments, corporations, and public institutions have been hard-pressed to cope with its humanitarian, economic, and ecological consequences3,8,36. However, the potentially more covert psychological dimension of the outbreak of war should also not be neglected. In particular, individuals living in Europe with existing vulnerabilities (i.e., low levels of trait Stability) are likely to be struggling to cope with crises such as the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.MethodsHere, we describe all procedures and measures relevant to this manuscript. A codebook providing a full presentation of all applied procedures and measures in this project can be retrieved from the OSF (osf.io/8f3yu/). This study was preregistered on June 23,\u00a02022, (osf.io/3uqtf) and represents the first publication based on data from this project. Our research complies with all relevant ethical regulations. The data collection for our project was approved by the institutional review board from the University of M\u00fcnster (see below).Data collection procedure and ethical approvalData were collected for this study as part of the \u201cCoping with Corona\u201d (CoCo) project, which comprises a global experience-sampling study with the goal of understanding individual differences in well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic11. Around the globe, participants took part in a 4-week study consisting of three phases: Upon registration, participants completed a large pre-survey that assessed personality traits and sociodemographic variables. Over the following four weeks, participants regularly completed up to four randomly timed short surveys throughout the day and an additional short survey at the end of each day. The surveys assessed their well-being, social interactions, attitudes, and more. After this 4-week experience-sampling period, participants completed a large post-survey that mostly consisted of the same items as the pre-survey.All researchers involved in the project disseminated a link to the online survey through various channels including social media, local and digital blackboards, mailing lists, university classes, recruitment panels, and local press releases in their respective countries. As compensation, participants received personalized personality feedback throughout and after the data collection period. They could also take part in a raffle of 10,000\u20ac (prizes ranged from 20\u20ac to 2,500\u20ac), and we donated 1\u20ac per participant to one of three charity organizations that participants could select. In Poland and the US, some participants additionally received direct monetary compensation, as they were recruited via research panels (Ariadna and TGM Research). The survey was conducted online via the open-source software formr version v0.18.337. The data collection for the global project was hosted completely on a local server at the University of M\u00fcnster, and no data point was at any moment stored outside Germany. The institutional review board from the University of M\u00fcnster approved the complete international study (2020-54-MB). All participants provided informed consent.Data inclusionThis study represents a post-hoc analysis of data that had already been collected, so no statistical method was used a priori to predetermine sample size. All data inclusion procedures and decisions described here were preregistered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/3uqtf) before the analyses were conducted. First, we restricted our data set to the period of one month (31 days) before and after the day of the Russian invasion (i.e., 31 days\u2009+\u20091 day\u2009+\u200931 days = 63 days; January 24 to March 27, 2022). Because we considered a symmetrical time frame around the outbreak of war, the linear developments before and after the event could be compared directly. We additionally conducted supplementary analyses in which we focused on a narrower (7 days before and after the Russian invasion) and a broader period (January\u00a01 to April 19,\u00a02022, the broadest possible symmetrical time frame around the Russian invasion excluding the Christmas holidays) to investigate whether the effect sizes found varied depending on the time frame. Second, all participants from non-European countries were excluded from our main analyses. These participants were included in supplementary analyses with the global sample. Third, we applied three additional data exclusion criteria and excluded a) participants who indicated on the last page of the post-questionnaire that they had not answered the questions in the survey conscientiously, b) participants who completed the pre-questionnaire too quickly (who took less than two seconds per item on average), and c) participants who provided state data on less than two days (this was minimally required to have variance on the change parameters).These procedures resulted in N\u2009=\u20091341 participants (44,894 experience-sampling reports) in the main analyses, N\u2009=\u2009341 (5604 experience-sampling reports) in the analyses with a shorter time frame, N\u2009=\u20091915 (76,716 experience-sampling reports) in the analyses with a longer time frame, and N\u2009=\u20091735 (54,851 experience-sampling reports) in the analyses with the global data. Of the 1341 participants included in the main analyses, 1079 were women, 252 were men, and 10 specified another gender. The mean age was 25.7 (min\u2009=\u200918, max\u2009=\u200991). Country-specific demographic statistics are presented in the supplement (Supplementary Table\u00a01).On March 14, 2022, there was a technical error that resulted in the submission of only a few assessments on that day. Hence, to avoid displaying a misrepresentative well-being score for this day, Fig.\u00a04 does not include any data from this day. However, the assessments from this day were included in all other analyses.Personality measuresThe Big Five traits were measured with the 60-item Big Five Inventory-238. Items were answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). Stability and Plasticity were calculated by aggregating individuals\u2019 Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and reversed Neuroticism scores (Stability) and their Extraversion and Openness scores (Plasticity). We considered only the trait data assessed in the pre-survey, because not all participants provided data in the post-survey.Sociodemographic variablesFor the sociodemographic variables, we assessed age, gender, subjective social status, and political orientation. Participants reported their age directly. For gender, participants could specify female, male, or another gender. As only ten participants specified another gender, we investigated gender effects by differentiating between female and male participants only. We assessed subjective social status with one item similar to the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status:39 Participants were asked to imagine a 10-step ladder representing the social positions of the population in their country and to indicate where they would place themselves and their family on this ladder ranging from 1 (at the bottom) to 10 (at the top). For political orientation, participants were asked to indicate how they generally view their political orientation on a scale ranging from 1 (extreme left) to 10 (extreme right).Well-being measuresWell-being was operationalized as the aggregate of positive affect and reverse-scored negative affect (also referred to as affective well-being40,41). Positive and negative affect were assessed in the randomly timed experience-sampling surveys throughout the day with three items each (\u201cI felt happy\u201d, \u201c\u2026enthusiastic\u201d, and \u201c\u2026relaxed\u201d for positive affect; \u201cI felt angry\u201d, \u201c\u2026afraid\u201d, and \u201c\u2026sad\u201d for negative affect). Items were answered on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (do not agree at all) to 6 (agree completely). As we expected that developments in the war would fluctuate more between days than within days, we aggregated the state-level data to the daily level for each participant. Daily well-being was calculated as the mean of the daily positive affect and reversed daily negative affect scores. In the main analyses, this procedure resulted in 17,990 daily well-being scores.Salience of the war in UkraineThe salience of the war in Ukraine was operationalized as the global number of daily tweets that contained the keyword \u201cUkraine\u201d. We retrieved this tweet count via the Twitter Researcher API v2. Days were defined within the UTC time zone.Measures for supplementary analysesFor supplementary and post-hoc analyses described below, we assessed societal well-being and various Ukraine-related behaviors, emotions, evaluations, and coping styles. Societal well-being was assessed daily in the evening questionnaire and operationalized as the combination of positive evaluations of, low threat perceptions towards, and high perceived similarity with people living in one\u2019s country. The positivity of other evaluations was assessed with the item \u201cHow positive or negative have you felt towards people in your country in general today?\u201d, answered on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (very negative) to 10 (very positive). Threat perceptions were assessed with the item \u201cHow threatened have you felt by people in your country in general today?\u201d, answered on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all threatened) to 10 (extremely threatened). The perceived similarity was assessed with the item \u201cHow similar have you felt to people in your country in general today?\u201d, answered on a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all similar) to 10 (extremely similar). Daily societal well-being was calculated by aggregating the daily positivity of other evaluations, reversed daily threat perceptions, and daily perceived similarity.The Ukraine-related items were included in most languages (excluding Portuguese, Polish, Turkish, and Thai) after the outbreak of the war and were introduced into the pre and post surveys between March 16\u00a0and March 23,\u00a02022. For participants who provided answers in both the pre and post survey, we only used the answers from the pre survey because they were closer in time to the outbreak of the war. The items assessing Ukraine-related behaviors, emotions, and evaluations were items created by the authors that are presented in Supplementary Table\u00a021. Most items were answered on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 6 (Strongly agree). The item \u201cHow much news do you consume in comparison to before the war in Ukraine?\u201d was answered with a slider ranging from 1 (clearly less) to 10 (clearly more) and the item \u201cI consider the political proceedings of my country concerning the war in Ukraine\u2026\u201d was answered with a slider ranging from 1 (very wrong) to 10 (very right). Ukraine-related coping styles were assessed with an adapted version of the 28-item Brief COPE42. This questionnaire assesses 14 coping strategies that can be aggregated into the three broader coping styles problem-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidant coping. The original instructions were changed so that participants explicitly referred to the Ukraine war when answering the items. In addition, some of the items were changed so that they made sense given the instructions (e.g., \u201cI\u2019ve been concentrating my efforts on doing something about the situation I\u2019m in\u201d was changed to \u201cI\u2019ve been concentrating my efforts on doing something about the situation in Ukraine.\u201d). Items were answered on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (A lot).Statistical analysesAll analyses were conducted using the software R version 4.2.143 and the packages lme444 and brms45. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance threshold of p\u2009<\u20090.05. All quasi-continuous trait-level variables (personality, age, subjective social status, political orientation, Ukraine-related variables) were z-standardized across participants. The numbers of Ukraine-related tweets were z-standardized across days. The well-being scores were z-standardized across all measurement points across all days. Note that there is no established consensus on how one should obtain standardized coefficients in multilevel models46 and our predictor variables were z-standardized in different ways (or not standardized in case of the change parameters described below). Thus, we refrain from referencing conventional benchmarks for effect sizes and refer to our model coefficients as unstandardized regression weights. However, as well-being scores were z-standardized across all measurement points across all days, model coefficients can be interpreted as changes in well-being on that scale.To identify how well-being developed over time, we fit eight multilevel models to the data in which daily scores (Level 1) were nested within individuals (Level 2). Each model contained a different combination of change parameters on Level 1 resulting in different changes in well-being over the weeks. The statistical operationalization of these parameters is illustrated in Table\u00a02. Each parameter can be interpreted in the following way: (1) when the time variable was used as a predictor of individuals\u2019 daily well-being, its effect represented linear changes in well-being over the weeks independent of the Russian invasion; (2) the respective effect of the level variable represented baseline level changes in well-being before versus after the Russian invasion; (3) the effect of the pre-event variable represented linear changes in the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion, indicating negative or positive anticipation effects; (4) the effect of the post-event variable represented linear changes in the weeks following the Russian invasion, indicating recovery or worsening effects over time.Table 2 Illustration of the change parameters around the Russian invasionFull size tableThe time as well as the pre- and post-event variables were rescaled so that they ranged from \u22121 to 1 (time), \u22121 to 0 (pre-event), and 0 to 1 (post-event) over the 63 days investigated in the main analyses. Therefore, the regression weights indicated average changes in well-being from the first day of the period investigated in the main analyses to the day of the invasion (pre-event) or average changes from the day of the invasion to the last day of the period investigated in the main analyses (post-event). Accordingly, these variables ranged from \u22120.194 to 0.194 in the analyses with a shorter and from \u22121.742 to 1.742 in the analyses with a longer time frame. Note that the values of the change parameters were the same for every person on any given date, but there was nonetheless between-person variance in the values of the change parameters aggregated across all days for individuals because participants could enter the survey at any time (resulting in individually shifted participation periods).We focused on eight multilevel models that result from different combinations of these parameters and that each represented different trajectories of well-being over time. All models were specified as random-intercept-random-slope models because model comparisons showed significant differences between the fit of the models with and without random slopes (i.e., random-intercept-constant-slope models). We compared the empirical evidence for these models simultaneously using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) because this allowed us to compare all models, including those that were not nested within each other. Table\u00a03 presents all models with their conceptual meaning, Level-1 equations, and a graphical illustration. The Level-2 equations are analogous for all models; for example, the full equation of Model 2d for time point i nested in person j is as follows, with the other models being defined accordingly:Table 3 Illustration of the interpretation, statistical definition, and illustration of the modelsFull size tableLevel 1:$${{{{{{\\rm{WB}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{ij}}}}}}} \\sim {\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{0j}}}}}}}^{{\\prime} }+{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{1j}}}}}}}^{{\\prime} }{{{{{{\\rm{preLin}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}+{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{2j}}}}}}}^{{\\prime} }{{{{{{\\rm{postLin}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}+{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{3j}}}}}}}^{{\\prime} }{{{{{{\\rm{level}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\rm{i}}}}}}}+{\\varepsilon }_{{{{{{\\rm{ij}}}}}}}$$Level 2:$$1.\\,{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{0j}}}}}}}^{{\\prime} }={\\beta }_{0}+{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{0j}}}}}}}^{\\ast }$$$$2.\\,{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{1j}}}}}}}^{{{\\prime} }}={\\beta }_{1}+{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{1j}}}}}}}^{\\ast }$$$$3.\\,{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{2j}}}}}}}^{{{\\prime} }}={\\beta }_{2}+{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{2j}}}}}}}^{\\ast }$$$$4.\\,{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{3j}}}}}}}^{{{\\prime} }}={\\beta }_{3}+{\\beta }_{{{{{{\\rm{3j}}}}}}}^{\\ast }$$The best-fitting model was Model 2d (AIC\u2009=\u200942,781). Model 2d had slightly more evidence in the data than Model 1d (AIC\u2009=\u200942,791) even though the fixed effect of the pre-event variable was not statistically significant in Model 2d. This difference between the models is likely a combined effect of the freely estimated fixed effect of the pre-event variable (which was nonsignificant but nonzero) and the freely estimated random effects of the pre-event variable (i.e., differences in anticipation effects between persons) in Model 2d. Model 2d was than extended by including Stability and the sociodemographic variables as Level-2 predictors of the random intercepts and random slopes in separate models, respectively. To investigate the influence of the salience of the war on daily well-being, we specified multilevel models in which the number of daily Ukraine-related tweets was used as a Level-1 predictor of daily well-being. We additionally split the salience indicator into a between-subjects component (the average salience per person across all days on which they participated) and a within-subjects component (the daily deviation between salience on that day and the respective person\u2019s average salience) and included both as predictors of daily well-being in the model. In the analyses investigating individual differences in the effects, we included Stability and the sociodemographic variables as Level-2 predictors of both the random intercepts and random slopes.We deviated from the preregistration by using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation instead of restricted ML (REML) because REML would not have allowed us to compare model fit using the AIC. As we faced model convergence issues for some of the models with the frequentist approach, we calculated all models using a Bayesian estimator as a robustness check. Here, we used the default, uninformative priors in the brms package47 and estimated the parameters based on four chains with 20,000 iterations each and a delta value of 0.99. These models converged and yielded results that were very similar to those from the frequentist analyses, replicating all reported significant effects and yielding almost identical effect sizes (Supplementary Tables\u00a022 to 40).Supplementary analysesWe conducted several supplementary analyses. First, because our data stemmed from different countries, we ran supplementary analyses for all main analyses in which we additionally included countries with at least 10 participants as dummy-coded variables as predictors of random intercepts in the models (the remaining countries were used as the reference category, Supplementary Tables\u00a05 and 6). As additional robustness analyses (not preregistered) on potential differences between countries, we excluded one of these countries at a time from the analyses to identify changes in well-being over time (and Stability predicting these changes, Supplementary Tables\u00a07 and 8). Second, we investigated whether the effect sizes found differed between European countries and the rest of the world. To this end, we conducted the main analyses with the complete, global sample and included a dummy-coded variable for European versus non-European countries as a predictor of the random intercepts (Supplementary Tables\u00a09 and 10). Third, we limited and extended our data set to the narrower and broader time frames, respectively, to investigate whether the effect sizes found varied by the investigated period (Supplementary Tables\u00a011 to 14). Fourth, we calculated models with the salience of the war in Ukraine predicting daily well-being on the consecutive day to check for lagged associations (Supplementary Table\u00a015). Fifth, we ran Model 2d including Stability as a predictor with the sub-facets of well-being (i.e., positive and negative affect). Analogously, we calculated the models with the respective Big Five domains instead, as well as with the second meta-trait, Plasticity, and its respective Big Five domains (Supplementary Tables\u00a016 and 17). Sixth, we ran all main analyses with societal instead of individual well-being as an outcome to investigate the specificity of the results found for individual well-being (Supplementary Tables\u00a018 to 20). Lastly, we conducted post-hoc supplementary analyses in which we used the Ukraine-related variables as Level-2 predictors of individuals\u2019 well-being in random-intercept multilevel models (Supplementary Table\u00a021).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Data availabilityThe raw and processed data that support the findings of this study are publicly available on the OSF (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/8F3YU).

It also tears at the fabric of culture. And in the case of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now about to enter its third year, the remarkable destruction of Ukrainian history and heritage since 2022 hasn\u2019t been a matter of collateral damage. Rather, the Russian military has deliberately targeted museums, churches and libraries that are important to the Ukrainian people. It\u2019s impossible to document the full extent of the destruction, particularly in the active military zones in eastern and southern Ukraine. However, as archaeologists and filmmakers, we wanted to do what we could. This meant traveling to liberated villages, museums and churches in northern and eastern Ukraine adjacent to regions with ongoing fighting. Working closely with Ukrainian colleagues, we ended up making two nine-day trips \u2013 one in March 2023 and another in October 2023.Here is some of what we found:Sifting through the ruinsIn liberated parts of Ukraine, the bodies of the dead have long been carried away and, for the most part, buried in local cemeteries. But enter any formerly occupied city or town, and you\u2019ll immediately notice that the scars from battles that took place from March 2022 to July 2022 remain starkly visible.  Driving around Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine, we witnessed hundreds of burned-out buildings, and many more that are riddled with bullet holes and damaged by shrapnel. As we wound through small farming villages, we were struck by the ferocity and randomness of modern military firepower: One part of a village could be completely flattened, while a block down the road, the houses were untouched.The Ukraine Hotel in Chernihiv, pictured in March 2023 after it had been bombed.Ian Kuijt, CC BY-SADuring a wet day in the middle of October 2023, we drove through small tree-lined roads to see the remains of the Church of the Ascension in Lukashivka, a small village about 8 miles from Chernihiv.Previously home to about 300 people, Lukashivka was occupied by the Russians in March 2022 and later recaptured by the Ukrainian military. Built in 1913 with a two-tiered belfry that can be seen for miles, this large white-brick church is now a shell of what it once was: Its wood flooring has been scorched and its brick roof blown open. In a few sections of the wall, the original plaster and paintings are still preserved.Inside the place of worship, we traversed the detritus of war, hearing the crunch of spent cartridges, rocket cases, broken bottles and heaps of burned cans.The Church of the Ascension in Lukashivka, a small village near the city of Chernihiv, in October 2023.Ian Kuijt, CC BY-SAWe\u2019ll never really know how many soldiers and civilians died fighting over Lukashivka and the church. We do know, however, that cultural heritage has few friends during war.The partially preserved church at Lukashivka is one of hundreds of cultural and religious buildings that have been damaged or destroyed over the last two years. This includes the Cathedral of the Transfiguration in Odesa, the Mariupol Drama Theater and the Korolenko Kharkiv State Scientific Library, one of the largest libraries in Europe.The authors explore the Church of the Ascension in Lukashivka, where intense fighting had taken place.More than meets the eyeIf traveling in Ukraine has taught us one important lesson, it\u2019s that the digging of trenches can erase history.  While the destruction of churches, libraries and museums viscerally evokes a sense of loss, there\u2019s an entire unseen world below the ground surface \u2013 filled with untold numbers of artifacts, bones and buried buildings \u2013 that are exposed when trenches are created.  In fact, it\u2019s likely that this war has destroyed more history and archaeology buried below the ground than above it. As armies did during World War I, the Ukrainian military built deep trenches and bunkers along rivers and high ground in the early months of the war. Two years later, these defensive trench systems are a central element of the ground war and demarcate the front lines.In many cases, the trenches were dug into the remains of buried archaeology sites, most of which were previously unknown and untouched.  A Ukrainian officer steps out of a trench network near the city of Kupiansk in eastern Ukraine.Scott Peterson/Getty ImagesIn March 2023, for example, we visited sites around Iripin and Bucha, two villages on the northern edge of Kyiv, to document how medieval and Bronze age sites buried below the surface had been destroyed by trenches or, in other cases, were now blanketed by minefields to stop Russian military units. We also went to the 11th century archaeology site of Oster. Perched on a small hill southeast of Chernihiv, Oster was an important regional center in the medieval period. It had a brick-and-stone church and a large settlement nearby. As part of the siege of Chernihiv in March 2022, Ukrainian troops built deep trenches and bunkers around the edges of Oster, since the site overlooks rivers and crossing points.When we visited Oster a year after the invasion, we noticed that the trench system around the church was dug into a large, 11th century settlement and burial ground. Laying exposed on the dirt piles along the trenches we found medieval human skeletal remains. The more we studied the system of trenches and bunkers, which encircles an area of about 650 feet (198 meters), the more human bones we saw.A crew of archaeologists has returned to photograph the destruction of these burial grounds. But given the ongoing war, it isn\u2019t possible to fully document the destruction, let alone fill in the trenches, which still may be needed by soldiers. The previously unknown burial ground at Oster is one of hundreds, if not thousands,  of similar sites that have been damaged or destroyed in central and northeastern Ukraine.The authors explore a system of trenches that had been built at Oster, an important medieval archaeological site.War and the fabric of cultureEven after the fighting ends, large areas of Ukraine will remain inaccessible for years, given the widespread use of mines and environmental contaminants. Surviving collections and museum exhibits inside and outside of Ukraine have assumed greater importance: They may represent the sole evidence of ancient cultures originating from these damaged territories.We can confidently say that Europe has not experienced destruction of this magnitude, let alone this quickly, since World War II.  The bombings of churches, libraries and residences have destroyed major areas of Ukraine. As with the Nazis\u2019 pilfering of paintings, bronze sculptures and art in the last few years of World War II, in the first months after the invasion the Russian army looted museums, stole art and destroyed churches with missiles and tank shells.  Make no mistake: At its core, the Russian full-scale invasion is a military attempt to erase Ukraine\u2019s history, culture and heritage.Seemingly entrenched in a 1950s geopolitical framework, President Vladimir Putin and other representatives of the Russian state dispute that Ukraine is a sovereign nation. Ukraine\u2019s churches, museums and libraries are a threat to Russia, for they are the material and symbolic fabric that holds together Ukrainian identity and resistance.

While Ukraine may have the footage of an ongoing invasion to prove its moral high ground, Russian Misinformation, Disinformation, and Malinformation (MDM) efforts across social media, as well as its continued reliance on compassion fatigue, cannot be discounted.The Digital Backdrop Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has set new precedents and pushed existing boundaries in all realms. It is being called the first commercial space war, the first full-scale drone war, and the first AI war. The invasion is unfolding amidst a status quo where a large majority of people receive breaking news through passive scrolling. Actors in both Russia and Ukraine have found ways to sway public opinion as the battle to shape the war\u2019s historical narrative continues.While the basis of traditional battle remains the same in the twenty-first century, many of the principal components of war now have a digital foundation to them. For example, intelligence on Russian troops\u2019 border movements and military plans was leaked and trending on social media right before Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the full-scale invasion. To this day, Ukrainian civilians resisting occupation can inform their army about Russian movements through social media and specially designed apps. Geo and chrono-located smartphone footage of military aggression under occupation can now spread through social media and even serve as evidence in international tribunals.Yet nowhere is the digital battlespace more prevalent than in the war of information. Both Russia and Ukraine have used every tool available to them and employed distinct tactics to shape public perceptions as the war continues.Ukraine\u2019s Reality of War The first hundred days of war are crucial. In early 2022, as the public reeled from the biggest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War, there was no better time for Ukraine to act.\u00a0 For Ukrainians, this involved sharing the reality of a population fighting occupation \u2014 including the parts that are hardest to stomach.The Bucha massacre in March of 2022 yielded footage of mass graves, destruction, and a viral photo of the lifeless, red-manicured hand of a young woman that took social media and news outlets alike by storm. The undeniable horror of the massacre and the resulting public outcry appealed to Western leaders\u2019 moral obligation to help Ukraine withstand Russian aggression.As the war continues and almost\u00a0 two years pass since the massacre, Ukrainians continue to showcase the human side of the war in an effort to keep onlookers engaged with their cause. They are doing this in two main ways. The first is through continued on-ground footage. Ukrainian stories involving the live footage of families being separated and civilians taking up arms have allowed the average user to connect and empathize with their struggle.The second instance primarily involves forming long-term bonds with an international audience across social media. Using short-form media platforms like TikTok to their advantage, Ukrainian content creators have been able to form parasocial bonds and raise awareness with their followers, to the point where supporting Ukraine becomes akin to supporting a friend. This has usually taken the shape of satiric takes on the Russian leadership or connecting with followers about a shared hobby. Such interactions remain a part of a bigger process to combat desensitization toward Ukrainian suffering as the war drags on.Social Media Dynamics and Misinformation: Enter Compassion FatigueSeeing the daily realities of war has led to a sentiment of guilt on social media that perpetuates mass posting. Many feel pressure to raise awareness and share posts about ongoing conflicts as a salient form of activism. While this may have helped put Western public opinion in Ukraine\u2019s court from the outset, mass posting has not always worked in Ukraine\u2019s favor.The speed of online updates born from millions of users and the scale of Russian aggression have pushed mainstream media outlets to rush and break stories that compete with the current pace of social media cycles before they have finished developing. This has undermined the value of legitimate open-source investigations being carried out to debunk Russian claims and unintentionally helped propagate misinformation that ultimately aids the Kremlin.Moreover, as other pressing conflicts continue to unfold in the world and ordinary citizens are confronted by their own problems, attention is bound to be diverted elsewhere. This manifests itself in a form of compassion fatigue (dubbed \u2018Ukraine Fatigue\u2019), where users become weary of the Ukrainian struggle for freedom on social media. It is under these conditions that the Russian capabilities in the information war begin to thrive.Russia and the (Anti) West Sentiments\u00a0As compassion fatigue sets in, Russian disinformation against Ukraine can permeate social media spaces more effectively. One of Russia\u2019s most successful information tactics on global public opinion about the war in Ukraine is a particular brand of malinformation that simply draws attention to Western faults.A tried and tested tool in the Russian arsenal since the Soviet era, malinformation refers to information that stems from the truth, yet is used intentionally in a way that misleads and actively causes harm. As Western governments have repeatedly expressed their commitment to help Ukraine withstand Russian aggression, the Kremlin has benefited from pointing out fraught Western history and its ongoing political blunders.Despite currently engaging in an active occupation, Russia has incited anti-Western sympathy and used it to gain ground through social media \u2014 particularly in countries that suffered from Western colonization, such as those in Africa and across Latin America. By reminding citizens of this painful history and stoking renewed anger against Western responses to current events, Russia continues to fuel a mistrust of Western narratives on social media.As the world becomes more polarized and the Russian invasion continues, anger towards Western governments can play a pivotal role in shaping the narrative of this conflict. Arguments surrounding double standards and hypocrisy have inflamed Ukraine fatigue, distract from Ukrainian plight, and can further shift the way social media users engage with this conflict. Such deflection is not an uncommon tactic for occupying powers, made even more possible now through artificial intelligence (AI).AI for WarThe speed with which AI has evolved since early 2022 means that further attempts to spread disinformation are growing more competent. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is one of the first conflicts where AI has been harnessed to push an alarming amount of disinformation.Russia has increasingly incorporated deepfakes and AI into its traditional disinformation campaigns against Ukraine. Fabricated recordings of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky surrendering as well as Russian troops celebrating and talking about their victory plans have been published on Telegram \u2014 a popular messaging app where many Ukrainians get their daily news \u2014 spreading panic and damaging morale. Doctored images with fascist symbolism directed toward Ukrainians have also been used to show them as \u201cunsympathetic victims\u201d to dehumanize the enemy and justify aggression.The presence of AI in manufacturing evidence to rationalize aggression in these spaces of conflict has become all too prevalent and must be counteracted. AI\u2019s potential to set a precedent of jumping into gratuitous aggression or lending credence to an occupying power during a conflict can set a deeply alarming precedent.Moving ForwardThe continuous information maelstrom surrounding Ukraine presents a valuable case study for how the realities of war shape public opinion. It has also demonstrated how state-sponsored misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation can fuel distrust and compassion fatigue for occupied countries. Russia relies on wearing the enemy out in every form of combat. Their MDM strategies, intent on lowering morale for Ukraine and spreading apathy towards the conflict, will likely aid in calls for political solutions that would freeze the present conflict \u2014 something that has consistently favored Russian strategic aims.As our world becomes more polarized, the contemporary shaping of the Russia-Ukraine narrative on social media will set the tone for future grounds of information warfare. Policy should focus on combating MDM by collaborating with digital platforms and hosting transparent discussions surrounding information warfare, the verification of online sources, and the promotion of digital literacy across social media. As tensions ramp up globally and information warfare continues in ways both predictable and nefarious, this increasing urgency must galvanize meaningful policy that roots out AI manipulation\u00a0 and centers ongoing dialogue for such conflicts around principles of compassion, aid, and humanity.\u2026Magdalene Karalis is an Academy Associate with the Russia-Eurasia Program at Chatham House.

After days of speculation that change was coming, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media that he was thankful for the service of the outgoing Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi \u2014 a military leader popular with troops and the general public. \u201cThe time for ... a renewal is now,\u201d Zelenskyy said on X. Zelenskyy appointed the commander of Ukraine\u2019s ground forces, Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, to lead the army, which needs a morale boost at a time when the conflict with Russia has been at a near stalemate for months. Syrskyi has been instrumental in Ukraine\u2019s biggest successes during the war, including overseeing the defense of the capital in the early days of the invasion.His ascension marks the most significant overhaul of Ukraine\u2019s military leadership since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 2022. Zaluzhnyi said in a Telegram message that he agreed there is a \u201cneed to change approaches and strategy.\u201d                    READ MORE                Everything you need to know about Russia\u2019s 2024 presidential electionA top EU official calls for a new defense industry strategy with locally made arms at its heartUkraine\u2019s Zelenskyy pleads for more ammunition at Albania summit of southeastern European nationsAn adviser to Zelenskyy, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on X that Ukraine needs to \u201cprevent stagnation on the front line, which negatively affects public sentiment, to find new functional and high-tech solutions that will allow (Ukraine) to retain and develop the initiative.\u201dSyrskyi, 58, was bestowed with the country\u2019s highest honor for his role in repelling Moscow\u2019s advance on the capital. He has also been credited with orchestrating the successful counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region.Ukraine\u2019s struggles with ammunition and personnel come on the heels of a failed counteroffensive last summer and as European allies try to bump up their military production. At the same time, a political standoff in the United States is holding up further aid from Ukraine\u2019s main supplier.The Kremlin has lately been focused on taking the eastern Ukraine city of Avdiivka, throwing more troops into the four-month battle and bombarding Ukrainian defenses there.Before Thursday\u2019s announcement, local media had speculated for days that Zelenskyy would sack Zaluzhnyi. Zaluzhnyi was highly regarded by his troops and by foreign military officials. Some analysts warned that his exit could bring unwelcome disruption, potentially driving a wedge between the Ukrainian army and its politicians, and fueling uncertainty among the country\u2019s Western allies.There has been little change in positions along the 1,500-kilometer (900-mile) front line over the winter, though Russia has kept up its attacks. Faced with an anticipated shortfall of Western weaponry, Ukraine has been digging defenses, while Moscow has put its economy on a war footing to give its military more muscle.Strains began to appear between Zaluzhnyi and Zelenskyy after the counteroffensive last summer failed to meet its goal of penetrating Russia\u2019s deep defenses. Western allies had poured billions of dollars\u2019 worth of military hardware into Ukraine to help it succeed.Months later, amid signs of war fatigue in the West, Zaluzhnyi described the conflict as being at a \u201cstalemate,\u201d just when Zelenskyy was arguing in foreign capitals that Ukraine\u2019s new weaponry had been vital.Zelenskyy said at the end of last year that he had turned down the military\u2019s request to mobilize up to 500,000 people, demanding more details about how it would be paid for.Born into a family of Soviet servicemen, Zaluzhnyi is credited with modernizing the Ukrainian army along NATO lines. He took charge seven months before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, and was widely regarded in the West as an ambitious and astute battlefield commander.Zaluzhnyi earned wide support after the defense of Kyiv in the early days of the war, followed by a triumphant counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region and the liberation of Kherson. His courage and defiance of Russia\u2019s ambitions were renowned, and he became a symbol of resilience and national unity.\u201cWe are on our land and we will not give it up,\u201d Zaluzhnyi said on the first day of the war.For months, a giant poster hung outside City Hall in Kyiv to honor him. Designed to look a stamp, it featured a fictional picture of Zaluzhnyi with his fingers in a victory gesture escorting Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 in handcuffs and an orange prisoner\u2019s jumpsuit \u2014 before three judges in wigs.Despite his popularity, Zaluzhnyi shied from the spotlight, deferring that role to Zelenskyy. He made limited public appearances and rarely gave interviews.Retired Australian Maj. Gen. Mick Ryan, a fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, described Zaluzhnyi as \u201ca charismatic and popular military leader\u201d who would be hard to replace.The perception of government instability \u201cis a real danger area for\u201d Zelenskyy, Ryan wrote recently in an article posted online.In Washington, The White House\u2019s national security spokesman, John Kirby, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cwe\u2019re not concerned about Ukrainian stability as a result of this.\u201d Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian forces claimed to have shot down a Russian attack helicopter in eastern Ukraine near the city of Avdiivka, where soldiers are fighting from street to street as Russia\u2019s army seeks to surround Kyiv\u2019s defending troops.Avdiivka has become \u201ca primary focus\u201d of Moscow\u2019s forces, the U.K. Defense Ministry said in an assessment Thursday.The General Staff of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces reported Thursday that its troops had fended off 40 enemy assaults around Avdiivka over the previous 24 hours. That is roughly double the number of daily Russian assaults at other points along the front line.Ukraine has built multiple defenses in Avdiivka, complete with concrete fortifications and a network of tunnels. Despite massive losses of personnel and equipment, Russian troops have slowly advanced since October.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

They also coordinate military plans and carry out joint military exercises.After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Nato said that it posed the \"most significant and direct threat to allies' security\".Which countries are Nato members?Nato has 31 members across Europe and North America, including the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Turkey. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries joined: Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.Sweden and Finland applied to join in May 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They had previously been neutral for decades.Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden's membership was delayed because of opposition from both Turkey and Hungary.Turkey said Sweden was giving refuge to Kurdish militants, and needed to do more to crack down on rebel groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which it considers a terrorist organisation. However, it decided to back Sweden's membership in January.Hungary's government, which was angry that Sweden had accused it of behaving undemocratically, has also now supported Sweden's membership.Steps will now be taken to formally make Sweden a Nato member.With Sweden and Finland joining Nato, it is seeing its biggest expansion since the 1990s. They will add nearly 300,000 active and reserve troops to the alliance's ranks.   Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia also hope to join Nato. How Sweden and Finland went from neutral to NatoWhen will Ukraine join Nato?Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said it is \"inevitable\" that Ukraine will become a member, but not until its war with Russia ends.President Zelensky has asked for Ukraine to be admitted as soon as possible afterwards.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nato boss Jens Stoltenberg has told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in \"the long-term\"Since July 2023, the Nato-Ukraine Council has coordinated efforts to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia.Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining Nato, fearing it would bring the alliance's forces too close to its own territory.Ukraine wants more than warm words over joining NatoHow much do Nato members spend on defence?Nato asks member states to spend at least 2% of their national income on defence.The US spends nearly 3.5% and several countries which border Russia - such as Poland and the Baltic Republics - also spend more than 2% on their armed forces. UK spending is just above the 2% target. However, countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain spent less than the target in 2023.Former US President Donald Trump, who is campaigning for re-election, controversially said he would encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough on defence.Nato said there was an \"unprecedented rise\" in defence spending by several members in 2023, and that 18 countries were expected to meet the 2% level in 2024.Biden slams Trump criticism of Nato as 'shameful'How much do Nato members spend on defence?What weapons are Nato countries giving Ukraine?As a group, Nato has not sent weapons to Ukraine, but several individual member countries have.The US, UK, Germany and Turkey have provided anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems, artillery guns, tanks and military drones.The US and UK have also supplied long-range missiles.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The US is supplying long-range ATACMS missiles to UkraineThe US is allowing two Nato countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, to transfer US-made F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, once pilots have been trained to fly them.Ukrainian media say the first planes could arrive in spring 2024.  However, Nato countries have not sent troops to Ukraine, and ruled out using their air forces to impose a no-fly zone over the country, because of fears such action could provoke a direct conflict with Russia.US releases last military aid for Ukraine for now Ukraine not alone says Sunak as UK pledges \u00a32.5bnWhat weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?How is Nato increasing its defences against Russia?In 2023, Nato commanders agreed detailed plans for countering possible Russian attacks in the Arctic and north Atlantic, central Europe, or the Mediterranean region. It also announced plans to increase the number of its troops in Europe on high alert from 40,000 to more than 300,000.

Both have traveled the world with the U.S. secretary of state to report on diplomacy over the war in Ukraine.Feb. 22, 2024\u9605\u8bfb\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u95b1\u8b80\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\u7248The Biden administration and European allies call President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia a tyrant and a war criminal. But he enjoys a standing invitation to the halls of power in Brazil.The president of Brazil says that Ukraine and Russia are both to blame for the war that began with the Russian military\u2019s invasion. And his nation\u2019s purchases of Russian energy and fertilizer have soared, pumping billions of dollars into the Russian economy.The views of the president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, encapsulate the global bind in which the United States and Ukraine find themselves as the war enters its third year.When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the Biden administration activated a diplomatic offensive that was as important as its scramble to ship weapons to the Ukrainian military. Wielding economic sanctions and calling for a collective defense of international order, the United States sought to punish Russia with economic pain and political exile. The goal was to see companies and countries cut ties with Moscow.But two years later, Mr. Putin is not nearly as isolated as U.S. officials had hoped. Russia\u2019s inherent strength, rooted in its vast supplies of oil and natural gas, has powered a financial and political resilience that threatens to outlast Western opposition. In parts of Asia, Africa and South America, his influence is as strong as ever or even growing. And his grip on power at home appears as strong as ever.The war has undoubtedly taken a toll on Russia: It has wrecked the country\u2019s standing with much of Europe. The International Criminal Court has issued a warrant for Mr. Putin\u2019s arrest. The United Nations has repeatedly condemned the invasion.And to hear Biden administration officials tell it, Russia has suffered a major strategic failure.\u201cToday, Russia is more isolated on the world stage than ever,\u201d Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken declared in June. Mr. Putin\u2019s war, he added, \u201chas diminished Russian influence on every continent.\u201dBeyond North America and Europe, there is evidence to the contrary.China, India and Brazil are buying Russian oil in record quantities, feasting on the steep discounts Mr. Putin now offers to countries willing to replace his lost European customers. With those growing economic relationships have come strong diplomatic ties, including with some close U.S. partners. Mr. Putin visited Beijing in October and hosted India\u2019s foreign minister in Moscow in late December. A few weeks earlier, Mr. Putin was warmly received in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where he was greeted with a 21-gun salute and fighter jets overhead trailing smoke in the red, white and blue of Russia\u2019s flag.ImagePresident Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Beijing last year. China has kept up commerce with Russia and is filling in gaps left by Western companies.Credit...Grigory Sysoyev/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesRussian influence is also expanding in Africa, according to a new report from the Royal United Services Institute, a security research group based in London. When Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, died last summer, Russia\u2019s military intelligence service took over Wagner\u2019s extensive operations in Africa and made further inroads with governments that rely on the group for security.\u201cBy no means is Russia boxed in,\u201d said Michael Kimmage, a Cold War historian at the Catholic University of America who was a State Department official in the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s not boxed in economically, it\u2019s not boxed in diplomatically and it gets its message out on the war.\u201dTo some Russia experts, American and European leaders have not fully reckoned with this reality.\u201cWhat Western leaders conspicuously haven\u2019t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia,\u201d Eugene Rumer and Andrew S. Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace wrote in November in an essay for The Wall Street Journal accusing the West of \u201cmagical thinking\u201d about Mr. Putin\u2019s plight.A prime example of the disappointment is Mr. Putin\u2019s welcome mat in Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest and most globally influential nation.Mr. Lula has extended an invitation to Mr. Putin to attend a Group of 20 leadership summit in Brazil in November, even though his country is a member of the International Criminal Court and is obliged to enforce the court\u2019s arrest warrant for the Russian leader. (Mr. Lula sidestepped questions in December about whether Mr. Putin would be arrested if he showed up, calling it a \u201cjudicial decision.\u201d)Brazil\u2019s persistently neutral stance on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine came up in a meeting on Wednesday in Bras\u00edlia, the nation\u2019s capital, between Mr. Lula and Mr. Blinken. Mr. Lula has called for peace talks, a position that Ukraine has criticized, and has said the United States is fueling the war with its weapons shipments to Kyiv. Mr. Blinken told Mr. Lula that the United States did not think conditions were right for diplomacy now.Later that day, Mr. Blinken landed in Rio de Janeiro for a meeting of foreign ministers from the Group of 20 nations and heard Brazil\u2019s top diplomat, Mauro Vieira, say, \u201cBrazil does not accept a world in which differences are resolved by using military force.\u201dSergey V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, was present. While Mr. Blinken and a handful of counterparts from allied nations denounced Russia\u2019s war, the other officials followed the Brazilian minister\u2019s lead in voicing neutral sentiments or stayed silent on the conflict.At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Blinken asserted that Mr. Lavrov had heard criticism throughout the meeting, saying there was a \u201cvery strong chorus\u201d that spoke on \u201cthe imperative of ending the Russian aggression.\u201dLast year, Mr. Lavrov attended a similar event in India. He visited more than a dozen African nations in 2023, including South Africa, Sudan and Kenya. And he was welcomed last April by Mr. Lula at the presidential residence, and was expected to see the Brazilian president again in Bras\u00edlia on Thursday.He met in New York last month with Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations \u2014 which Russia\u2019s foreign ministry advertised in a news release that showed the two men shaking hands.At the United Nations, U.S.-led resolutions condemning the war have found little support among countries that are not closely aligned with the United States or Russia, demonstrating their reluctance to be forced to take a side in the conflict.\u201cThese countries are wary of being seen as pawns on a chessboard of great-power competition,\u201d said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington. \u201cThe last administration did a lot of damage to our relationship with a lot of these countries. We haven\u2019t been seen as a credible partner.\u201d\u201cRussian disinformation has been effective in a lot of places,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd in a lot of these countries, Russia has invested for decades.\u201dMoscow has also worked to avoid blame for higher food and energy prices that followed its invasion. Several weeks ago, Russia delivered 34,000 tons of free fertilizer to Nigeria, one of several such shipments it has sent to Africa.Mr. Putin can afford such largess, not to mention a war of attrition in eastern Ukraine, because Russia has replaced lost energy customers in Europe by selling far more on other continents. The International Energy Agency reported last month that Russia exported 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in December, the highest in nine months \u2014 and only slightly below prewar levels.At the same time, its oil export revenues were $14.4 billion that month, the lowest in a half-year. The agency said Western efforts to enforce a price cap on Russian oil appear to have bitten into overall revenues, as has a decrease in the global market price of crude oil.Russia\u2019s standing is benefiting from President Biden\u2019s support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, analysts say. Many leaders see hypocrisy in American condemnations of Russian strikes on civilian areas and infrastructure in Ukraine, unmoved by the argument that Israel works to avoid civilian casualties while Russia has deliberately targeted innocents.Beyond that, Russia has succeeded in forming tighter bonds with its close partners, what Ms. Polyakova calls a \u201cnew authoritarian alliance.\u201d Those countries \u2014 China, North Korea and Iran \u2014 have given aid to Moscow in various forms. North Korea is sending ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine, Iran continues to ship drones and China, while refraining from exporting arms to Russia, is allowing equipment that civilians and the military can use to get into Moscow\u2019s hands.ImageSergey V.

The U.N. has repeatedly condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.Credit...Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesChina has kept up commerce with Russia and is filling in gaps left by Western companies, ensuring a supply of everything from household goods to financial services. As for sanctions meant to limit Russia\u2019s access to high technology, particularly equipment that could be used for modern weapons, Mr. Putin has found workarounds. Nearby countries like Armenia and Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have not joined the U.S. sanctions regime, and private companies there import microchips and other items for re-export to Russia.Western sanctions and business boycotts have certainly affected daily life in Russia, though in many cases through inconveniences like the loss of Apple Pay and Instagram \u2014 not enough to foment popular unrest or change Mr. Putin\u2019s behavior.\u201cIn the here and now, the sanctions have disappointed,\u201d said Edward Fishman, a former State Department official in the Obama administration who oversaw Russia sanctions after Mr. Putin annexed Crimea in 2014.Over time, Mr. Fishman said, Western sanctions will take a greater toll. Despite loopholes and black market trade, Russia will struggle to acquire critical high-technology components. And ruptured deals with Western energy companies will deprive Russia of the investment it needs to maintain efficient oil and gas production.But he said that Mr. Putin had prepared his country for an onslaught of sanctions, and that he had come up with enough options to maintain his war machine and leverage on the world stage.\u201cUnfortunately, Russia has now built a kind of alternative supply chain,\u201d said Mr. Fishman, a senior research scholar at Columbia University.He added that Mr. Biden could take even bolder steps to crack down on Russian energy exports and technology imports. But that would mean friction with nations that have become major buyers of Russian oil, like India, who might reduce their imports only under the threat of sanctions or other punitive measures that could risk a diplomatic crisis.Similarly, many businesses enjoying big profits from serving as middlemen for banned technology items are in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, two partners whom Mr. Biden would rather not confront.Perhaps most daunting is the fact that curtailing Russian oil exports is likely to drive up global oil prices \u2014 bad news for the United States and a president facing voters this fall.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of nerves about doing anything that can rattle global oil markets,\u201d Mr. Fishman said, \u201cespecially in an election year.\u201dEdward Wong is a diplomatic correspondent who has reported for The Times for more than 24 years from New York, Baghdad, Beijing and Washington.

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty/Serhii Nuzhnenko via REUTERSTwo years into the Russia-Ukraine war, fighting along the front remains stalled. Calls for a negotiated settlement have grown, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected the possibility of ceding territory and directly negotiating with Russia, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has proven unreliable even if an agreement could be reached. War fatigue in the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies is also complicating their ability to continue securing flows of military and economic aid to Ukraine. Amid this uncertainty, sixteen Council of Councils experts from thirteen countries reflect on ways to contain or end the war. The responses differ sharply in some cases, demonstrating a divided world\u2019s approach to a complex situation. Submissions are organized into three categories: those calling for additional financial and military support for Ukraine, pathways for diplomacy and a ceasefire, and how to rethink current mindsets.\u00a0 Financial and Military Support for UkraineNona MikhelidzeSenior Fellow,\u00a0Institute of International Affairs (Italy)Riccardo AlcaroResearch Coordinator and Head of Global Actors Program, Institute of International Affairs (Italy)A Negotiated Settlement Now Would Make Things Worse\u00a0As Russia\u2019s war of conquest in Ukraine nears its second anniversary, war fatigue has come to dominate the Western media. With Ukraine\u2019s inconclusive counteroffensive in 2023 resulting in a positional war in which neither party seems capable of gaining the upper hand, calls for a settlement have grown. However imperfect, the argument goes, a settlement would at least end the violence. People would stop dying. Ukraine\u2019s economy would benefit. Diplomacy would be given a chance to find a long-term solution. If only. The reality is that there is every reason to believe that a settlement now would make things worse.Consider the following. What would such a settlement look like? Surely, it would not be a peace treaty. Russia would not agree to withdraw its troops from territory it has formally annexed. Ukraine would never recognize Russia\u2019s territorial acquisitions, which would continue to be Ukrainian land under international law. The West would keep the sanctions regime in place. The frontline would remain militarized. The result would be a frozen conflict, in which the parties would continue to pursue their original objectives\u2014for Ukraine, liberation; for Russia, conquest\u2014with different tactics. Russia would likely resort to subterfuge, provocation, intimidation, and influence operations meant to hamper Ukraine\u2019s economic reconstruction and political democratization, which in turn could weaken Western support for Kyiv. Kyiv and Moscow would remain at loggerheads. In the end, violence, even large-scale violence, would most likely flare up again, as it eventually has in most frozen conflicts from the Soviet area, including in Georgia\u2019s regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which have been de facto integrated into Russia after the latter\u2019s military intervention in 2008, and Nagorno-Karabakh, where a thirty-year stalemate ended last year when Azerbaijani troops swept into the ethnic Armenian enclave. If this happens, the West would be hard pressed to go back to its original strategy of supporting Ukraine militarily or accept Russia\u2019s further advancements and face a much-worsened security landscape in Europe and beyond, given the ramifications for the West\u2019s global standing following defeat in Ukraine. Most Western leaders are probably aware that President Putin will not be content with anything other than the complete subjugation of Ukraine. They should set aside any lingering hesitations and delays in arms deliveries and start acting upon the assumption that supporting Ukraine \u201cas long as it takes\u201d is not the right approach\u2014if it were, Putin would have made concessions at this stage. Instead, the West should do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to ensure Ukraine wins its battle for independence.Daniel SzeligowskiHead of Eastern Europe Programme, Polish Institute of International Affairs (Poland)We Cannot Indefinitely Kick the Can Down the Road \u00a0Two years on from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the West keeps running away from difficult decisions. To be sure, Ukraine would no longer be able to defend itself were it not for the collective effort of the transatlantic community. Yet, half-hearted measures like slow-rolling military support only address half of the problem. The West has fed Ukraine enough militarily to make it too big to swallow for Russia, but failed so far to curb the Russian appetite. Having digested yet another part of occupied Ukraine, Russia will come back with even greater vigour.Too many Western policymakers still delude themselves that a compromise with Russia is possible, as if its invasion of Ukraine were a mere unfortunate accident on a somewhat bumpy, but steady, road toward settlement with Russia. Putin will get no rest until he either subjugates Ukraine or destroys it. This imperial self-conception is not just his, but that of Russian elites at large. What happens in Ukraine will not stay in Ukraine. Russia\u2019s long-term strategic goal is to bring back its global power status and recreate a security order built on spheres of influence, and it will not shy away from deploying people and resources from conquered Ukraine against the West. Instead of targeting its symptoms, the disease of Russian expansionism must be tackled directly. Time has not yet run out, but the window of opportunity is slowly closing. Western leaders should stop kicking the can down the road and face the unpleasant challenge of how to thwart, once and for all, Russian plans to subjugate Ukraine. This requires credible commitment to build up Ukraine\u2019s defenses so it can recover as much territory as possible, and subsequently provide the country with firm security guarantees.Admittedly, the West has struggled to mobilize more resources and is still not ready to deploy troops on the ground to secure Ukraine, but make no mistake\u2014the war will drag on until the West eventually steps in and fully embraces Ukraine. Therefore, the shortest path to ending this war runs through Ukraine\u2019s accession to NATO, which would be the least costly, and, simultaneously, most effective stabilizing option for the broader transatlantic community. An accession to NATO would likely entail a painful delay for Kyiv in regaining some of the occupied territories, which Article 5 would temporarily not cover\u2014the ultimate price to be paid for our foot-dragging in arming Ukraine.Otherwise, Russia will keep bleeding Ukraine\u2014and our pockets\u2014out.Steven BlockmansSenior Research Fellow, Centre for European Policy Studies (Brussels) Freeze, Seize, and Tax\u00a0With President Biden\u2019s support package stuck in Congress, the decision by the European Union to send an annual $13.5 billion in budget support to Ukraine for the next four years is a much-needed emergency injection that will prevent sovereign default. But it will be insufficient to protect the country from further military onslaught, let alone allow it to rebuild. According to the\u00a0International Monetary Fund, Ukraine would need at least $37 billion in external support this year to remain resilient. Given the scale of the potential financial commitment, alternative funding sources should be considered.The\u00a0seizure of $300 billion in frozen Russian Central Bank (RCB) assets by Group of Seven (G7) countries, $205 billion of which are in the European Union,\u00a0has long been touted as a\u00a0potential funding source for Ukraine. While the United States, Belgium, Czechia, and Estonia have looked into how to use freezes within a national context, the G7 debate has\u00a0lingered due to both international law concerns and fears about Russian retaliation. The European Central Bank has also warned that the move could undermine investor confidence in the euro, leading to capital flight and volatility in financial markets.Such concerns should not be blown out of proportion. It is vital that international investors not perceive the action as arbitrary and risky. In fact, such a course would be legally justifiable given Russia\u2019s blatant violations of the UN Charter and international criminal law, including the 1948 Genocide Convention. Retaliatory measures from Russia would only unsettle global markets if China, Saudi Arabia, and other economic powerhouses felt that divestment from the eurozone would be worth the economic pain in the short to mid-term. Chances of such a decision are low.The status of the euro as a reserve currency is strong, thanks to the lure of the single market and its democratic underpinnings anchored in the rule of law. If confiscation were to happen simultaneously in all G7 countries, the risk of the euro losing points on its star rating would be mitigated. To avoid undermining the euro\u2019s status\u2014and that of the dollar, yen, and pound\u2014diplomatic channels should be used to persuade other countries, Switzerland in particular, to close ranks with the G7.In a show of support for Ukraine ahead of the second anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion, EU member states have unanimously agreed to set aside windfall profits generated from RCB assets immobilized in Europe. Future proceeds (estimated at more than $4 billion per year) will be booked separately and not paid out as dividends to shareholders until member states decide to set up a financial contribution to the EU budget that shall be raised on these net profits to support Ukraine. That levy, the EU believes, is consistent with applicable contractual obligations and in accordance with international law.Another levy worth considering is for G7 countries to make Western companies pay for the privilege of continuing to do business in Russia despite sanctions. While some of the world\u2019s largest companies have completely pulled out from Russia, most EU and G7 firms maintain a foothold in Russia to \u2018honor\u2019 existing contracts. Taxing them would make them pay for their contribution to Russia\u2019s war effort against Ukraine.Lila Rold\u00e1n V\u00e1zquezSecretary General and Head of the Eurasian Affairs Committee,\u00a0Argentine Council for Foreign Affairs (Argentina)Why Ukraine Should Win This War\u00a0Victory for Ukraine is the rightful outcome of this war for many reasons. Saving thousands of lives is what first comes to mind. Defending Ukraine\u2019s independence, territorial integrity, and democratic future are also obvious. Ensuring European security and energy supply, reining in the advance of autocracies, and dispelling the danger of a wider and far more dangerous confrontation with Russia are meaningful reasons as well.The feasibility of Ukraine\u2019s victory depends on two conditions: unwavering Western military and economic support and the will of the Ukrainian people to resist until victory is achieved. Victory also requires Russian acceptance of a more limited regional role. It won\u2019t be easy. War fatigue is spreading as the conflict enters its third year, and international attention is understandably drawn to the Israel-Hamas confrontation and its regional implications.A Russian victory raises many questions for Ukraine: Would it accept the loss of a significant part of its territory? What will happen to the population of the occupied territories and to the twenty thousand or more stolen Ukrainian children? And will the Russification policies carried out by the Kremlin be effective on a population that has endured occupation, filtration camps, and the destruction of their homes, schools, and cities?Given what we know about the history of Ukraine and the determination of its people, it also remains to be seen whether permanent partisan activity would undermine the Russian occupation with the constant risk of a new war.If there were an armistice or peace agreement without a Ukrainian victory, it is doubtful that Russia would comply. From the 1654 Pereyaslav Treaty to the 1984 Budapest Memorandum to the 1997 Russian\u2013Ukrainian Friendship Treaty, history has shown Russia to disregard or directly violate most of its bilateral or multilateral agreements. The world cannot assume that this time will be different.Nevertheless, even if a Ukrainian victory would be the fair, morally acceptable outcome, Russia will forever be a neighbor to the European Union and NATO. A compromise must be reached among Russia, Ukraine, and NATO to ensure lasting peace on the continent. Russia needs to honor its international commitments and, consequently, restore and respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. A mutual nonaggression pact should also be reached between NATO and Russia, with built-in guarantees for the latter to be reassured regarding its alleged security concerns.This is not just about Ukraine and the future of its people. World security is at stake if imperial autocrats get their way through force and violation of international law.Selim YenelPresident, Global Relations Forum (Turkey)The Only Way to End This War Is to Defeat Putin \u00a0The Russia-Ukraine war, which actually started in March 2014 with the invasion of Crimea, continues to move in stages. President Putin has not accepted the demise of the Soviet Union and his policies have been geared to compensate for that loss. Georgia and Moldova also have Russian troops on their soil. Hoping for a quick resolution to his February 2022 invasion, President Putin failed miserably in Ukraine and the war is still raging. In 2023, there was talk of Ukraine not only stopping Russia but also repelling it. However, it is now clear that the outcome of this protracted war will depend on who is more resilient. Despite Russia\u2019s superior numbers and equipment, the most debated issue this year is whether the West, particularly the United States, will continue its support for Ukraine.Even if one agrees or disagrees on the origins of recent attacks in several regions, they all have one thing in common: warring countries or nonstate actors no longer expect negotiations or diplomatic resolutions that have been postponed for years, even decades. The Russian aggression in Ukraine is only the latest example. It is evident that the post\u2013World War II international order headed by the United States is threatened. As a result of the war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Russia and the United States have taken turns blocking resolutions at the UN Security Council. The Council is not functioning, and without reform, is destined to be obsolete. Disinformation is another problem compounding these challenges as technology advances at a rapid rate.The Russia-Ukraine war will most probably continue until one side is depleted. The only way to end this war is to defeat Putin, the primary cause of it all. However, even a Russian defeat may seem to be a pause, with fighting only to flare up again later. The world is watching how the West responds, whether it will resist or capitulate. The impact of a possible second Trump administration will be significant for Ukraine, Europe, and beyond. The resulting ramifications will resonate globally. Hard power calls for hard power. As a result, after years of obfuscation, the European Union should finally develop a deterrent system apart from the United States. Since Washington\u2019s involvement in Europe is not guaranteed, it must rely on its own resources to defend itself.\u00a0\u00a0  Pathways for Diplomacy and a CeasefireGustavo de CarvalhoSenior Researcher, African Governance and Diplomacy Programme, South African Institute of International Affairs (South Africa)Africa\u2019s Potential Role in Mediating the Ukraine Conflict\u00a0In the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Africa became an unexpected focus of global attention. Over the past decade, Russia has escalated its presence across Africa, repositioning itself as a burgeoning power in the global race for influence on the continent. This situation divided African countries at the United Nations, evidenced by a nearly split vote on General Assembly resolutions condemning the invasion.The rise in fuel, fertilizer, and grain prices in 2022, a direct consequence of the conflict, inadvertently propelled many African countries toward more proactive diplomatic stances that deviated from the expectations of the Western and Russian sides. An intriguing development occurred in June 2023 with the African Peace Initiative. Spearheaded by seven African countries\u2014Comoros, Congo-Brazzaville, Egypt, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia\u2014this coalition presented a document to Ukraine and Russia that provided a clearer and more balanced African stance on the conflict for the first time. Leading these efforts de facto, South Africa has since engaged actively with Russia and Ukraine, demonstrating the continent\u2019s potential leverage in future negotiations. African states did not align with Western demands for sanctions against Russia. However, their participation in the Ukraine Peace Formula elicited criticism from Russia, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted at the first 2024 BRICS Sherpa meeting. This balanced position by African countries presents a unique opportunity for the continent to mediate this conflict. Mediation, an intricate blend of art and science, demands strategic patience, proper positioning of stakeholders, and identifying engagement opportunities until the moment is ripe for negotiations. The conflict in Ukraine, characterized by its complexity and seemingly intractable nature, underscores the importance of potential mediators in constructing avenues for dialogue.A negotiated settlement becomes more realistic if the conflict reaches a mutually hurting stalemate. We are not quite there yet. Thus, identifying the timing for mediation is tricky, as limited information and developments on the ground make it difficult to assess the sense of urgency and readiness to negotiate. However, with their extensive experience in mediation, established relationships with Western states and Russia, and support from the Global South, African countries are well-positioned to bridge the divide when the time is ripe. Their role could be instrumental in fostering a negotiated settlement, underscoring the continent's emerging significance in addressing global geopolitical disputes. The world\u2019s powers should not write off Africa\u2019s role so quickly.Nicholas Idris EramehSenior Research Fellow, Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (Nigeria)Concrete Steps Toward Peace: A Ceasefire and No Ukraine Membership in NATO\u00a0The Russia-Ukraine war appears to have reached a stalemate as it moves into its third year. Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive has been unable to drive back Russian forces or recover lost territory, despite the overwhelming support of the United States and other NATO countries. The Russian military has also not made significant advances in its attempts to seize additional territory. Yet the destruction of towns and villages, as well as the loss of life, continues on a hideous and unacceptable scale. Given the growing human insecurity within the region, the need to resolve the conflict has become increasingly compelling. Thus, the time has come for the world to make more concrete efforts at ending the war. First, the UN Security Council has to work out a humanitarian ceasefire that should be agreed to by Russia, Ukraine, and their allies. This should serve as a starting point for potential peace negotiations. Second, both nations should be persuaded into beginning direct talks as a prelude to peace negotiations. Third, NATO, the United States, and their allies must abandon the extremely divisive and dangerous notion of offering Ukraine NATO membership. Moscow\u2019s long-standing concerns about Ukraine\u2019s potential NATO membership and resultant threat such a move poses remain at the core of the conflict. While Russia is uncomfortable with Finland and Sweden joining NATO, it does not view those developments with the same desperation and trepidation as Ukraine\u2019s membership. Therefore, NATO should respect geopolitical and strategic boundaries, abandon the notion of Ukraine\u2019s accession, and, alternatively, aim at securing UN Security Council-protection guarantees for Ukraine after the war. Fourth, to defuse the tension in East-West relations, Ukraine's Western allies should attempt a rapprochement with Russian President Vladimir Putin rather than continue their current policy of hostility and regime change in Moscow. This is necessary to end the contentious foot dragging diplomacy that has crippled the UN Security Council since the war broke out.Fifth, Russia needs to be persuaded to renounce the claim to the so-called \u201cbreakaway territories\u201d of Donetsk and Luhansk as part of a peace deal to end the conflict. In contrast, Ukraine may need to acknowledge the pre-invasion status of Crimea under Russian control. Sixth, the UN Security Council and other organizations should ensure adherence by both parties to existing and emerging peace deals to ensure sustainable peace in the region. Zhao LongDeputy Director and Senior Fellow of the Institute for Global Governance Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China)A Blueprint for Conditional Peace\u00a0The situation in Ukraine is a political and military deadlock. With the political uncertainty of the so-called year of elections, Europe could further be divided on aid to Ukraine, while a second Trump administration in the United States could lead to a disconnect within the transatlantic alliance. Nevertheless, those uncertainties also present a window of opportunity for diplomacy. Although 2024 may not usher in peace for Ukraine, it could be pivotal for international cooperation on unlocking the stalemate.First, Ukraine and its allies must define suboptimal victory. While preserving Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity remains the ultimate goal, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges it presents. Ukrainian forces advanced an average of only ninety meters per day during the peak of their counteroffensive, with less than 1 percent of its territory retaken in 2023. This indicates that Ukraine's goal of restoring the 1991 border will demand considerable time, resources, and casualties, and may become the lonely fight of President Zelenskyy. Establishing a robust defense and negotiations to restore the pre-war status could be seen as a more realistic definition of Ukraine\u2019s victory.Second, all parties must consider a situation of frozen conflict as the conditional peace. Although the frozen conflict cannot completely resolve the security dilemma, it can significantly reduce casualties and spillover effects, paving the way for a peace process starting with a ceasefire. This approach has proven effective in the Korean Peninsula, the Middle East, and Georgia, making Ukraine another potential candidate for such a strategy.Third, Russia, Ukraine, and their allies should facilitate a phased ceasefire framework. Given the distrust between Russia and Ukraine and Ukraine ruling out any negotiations, backchannel diplomacy and track-two dialogues are crucial. If the U.S.-led coalition can negotiate a feasible phased ceasefire framework based on Ukraine\u2019s peace formula, countries in the Global South could establish a contact group to facilitate regular communication between Russia and Ukraine. This platform could explore conditions for a phased ceasefire, troop withdrawal, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone under UN peacekeeping force supervision.Fourth, NATO should devise interim measures for Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership. Ukraine's accession to NATO could prompt Russia to fortify its security buffer zone through new territorial realities, potentially challenging NATO\u2019s collective security obligations under Article 5. Negotiating long-term security cooperation agreements with major countries could serve as an interim measure for Ukraine's security.Fifth, Russia, Ukraine, their allies, and mediators should craft a goal-based negotiation package. Simply retaking Russian-controlled territories won\u2019t ensure lasting peace. Resolving the conflict requires long-term security assurances for Ukraine, addressing Russia\u2019s legitimate security concerns, designing territorial sovereignty arrangements, and a comprehensive negotiation package on Ukraine, the European security architecture, and transatlantic strategic stability. Omotola Adeyoju IlesanmiSenior Research Fellow, Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (Nigeria)Time for a Full-Court Diplomatic Effort to End War\u00a0The Russia-Ukraine war has been raging for two years, and it doesn\u2019t appear that the destruction and military assault will stop soon. It is undeniable that the conflict is complex and will be difficult to settle as both warring parties are adamant about winning the war. Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin have both made distinct appeals to other countries to secure support to win the war.Russia has turned to China, India, and the Global South, while the United States and Europe have been unwavering in their support for Ukraine. Diplomacy has taken a backseat as the current emphasis is primarily on victory on the battlefield. By giving parties with disparate interests or points of view a forum for dialogue and discussion, diplomacy plays a critical role in both preventing and ending wars. To resolve the ongoing crisis, diplomatic engagement through negotiations and mediation needs to be given more consideration. Further, it ought to take precedence over other inefficient measures, such as using military force to accomplish political goals. To find a compromise, mediation groups made up of impartial, neutral nations should engage with Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin. Similarly, citizen-led initiatives and mediation efforts involving respected international leaders and nonstate entities should also play a part. The Global South should play a decisive diplomatic role in resolving the conflict. It is important to support and replicate the African Peace Delegation made up of African leaders\u2014including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Senegalese President Macky Sall, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Comorian President Azali Assoumani, and high-ranking representatives from Egypt and Uganda\u2014in their efforts to negotiate with the warring parties. It would also be beneficial to establish and promote more third-party interventions from the Global South to mediate and negotiate a peaceful settlement to the dispute. This is significant because it is now clear that the West and the Global North are incapable of or unwilling to end the war peacefully.Even though several diplomatic attempts for a ceasefire have been made, more possibilities for communication and a negotiated end of this conflict should be explored. It is important to consolidate the gains made possible by diplomatic efforts, such as the UN and Turkish-mediated Black Sea Grain Initiative, which was instrumental in preventing a global food crisis. Despite the complexity of the problems, they are not insurmountable. A greater focus should be placed on reaching a settlement through negotiations that can end the war by addressing both nations\u2019 security concerns and settling their territorial dispute. Abdulaziz SagerChair, Gulf Research Center (Saudi Arabia)The Gulf Cooperation Council States Could Help in De-escalation\u00a0The outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war is more uncertain than ever. The Western unity behind Ukraine is starting to show its first cracks, mostly due to domestic political considerations in countries such as the United States, Hungary, and Slovakia. The European Union was only able to overcome Hungary\u2019s objection to a $50 billion military assistance package for Ukraine at its emergency summit meeting in early February after months of delay, and approval of new U.S. Congressional funding remains doubtful. While continued military assistance is critical for the Ukrainian war effort, much will depend on the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, where the potential return of Donald Trump would likely mark a significant shift in U.S. policy toward Russia. In the meantime, President Putin is content to play the waiting game in hopes that Western solidarity will further weaken. With the Middle East facing its own crisis in Gaza following the attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have maintained an overall balanced position on Ukraine. On the one hand, the Arab Gulf has condemned the invasion in numerous votes at the United Nations and upheld humanitarian assistance programs for Ukraine. On the other hand, Gulf states have maintained diplomatic channels with Russia. This is part of an overall approach that prioritizes open communication channels to all parties ultimately resolve the conflict. The GCC states are not in a position to contain nor end the conflict in Ukraine. Yet they can provide a platform for discussions over possible resolution efforts. Recent mediation steps led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to facilitate Ukrainian-Russian prisoner exchanges are one example of this. The hosting of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy during the Arab League summit and the holding of peace talks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in August 2023 are other contributions that GCC states have made. Moreover, during his visit to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in December 2023, Russian President Putin expressed his support for continued mediation efforts. This suggests other actors can facilitate the exploration of de-escalating steps and find a potential resolution. Managing an Intractable ConflictCharles A. KupchanSenior Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations (United States)Ukraine Needs a Strategic Reorientation\u00a0Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has reached an inflection point in two critical respects. First, the offensive that Ukraine launched last summer failed to break through Russian defenses. At best, a military stalemate has settled in; at worst, Russia is poised to make further offensive advances. For now, and likely for the foreseeable future, Ukraine has no realistic prospect of restoring territorial integrity by force.Second, although the governments of most NATO allies remain firmly committed to helping Ukraine resist Russian aggression, their ability to continue securing substantial flows of military and economic aid to Ukraine has become uncertain. Constraints on U.S. and European weapons stockpiles are part of the problem. But the more telling shift is political. Europe struggled to win approval of its new $54 billion package of economic assistance. In the United States, Republicans have so far blocked President Biden\u2019s effort to secure some $60 billion in additional aid for Ukraine. Even if Congress eventually does approve a new package, political obstacles to supporting Ukraine are mounting on both sides of the Atlantic.Under these circumstances, Ukraine has no choice but to pivot from an offensive to a defensive military strategy, focusing on consolidating its hold on the 80 percent of the country under Kyiv\u2019s control. Ukraine needs to devote available manpower and resources to holding the line, preventing Russia from advancing on the battlefield while forcing Russian forces to suffer the heavy losses that come with efforts to break through defensive lines. Meanwhile, Ukraine should continue to hamper Russian operations and raise costs by striking deep behind the front lines and targeting Russian positions in Crimea and naval assets in the Black Sea.This reorientation, by laying out a strategy that matches available means to attainable ends, would help consolidate Western support for Ukraine. That goal is urgent. The U.S. Congress needs to act immediately to provide Ukraine with the air defense capabilities, ammunition, and other assets it needs to hold off continuing Russian advances and defend its cities and economic infrastructure against Russian attacks.As it pivots to defense, secures Western support, and blocks further Russian advances, Ukraine also needs to develop a roadmap for strengthening its economic and political resilience. That means readying plans for reconstruction and taking advantage of candidacy for EU membership by working hard to implement the economic and political reforms required for accession. It means working with its Western supporters to provide the military capability to defend itself for the long haul. Even if Russian President Vladimir Putin no longer seeks to conquer Ukraine militarily, he may well try to turn it into a failed state. Defeating Russian aggression means ensuring Ukraine emerges from this war as a prosperous and secure democracy.The door to diplomacy should remain open. In his recent interview with Tucker Carlson, Putin expressed interest in efforts to \u201cnegotiate\u201d an end to the war, calling for Ukraine to cede territory to Russia. While that proposal is a nonstarter for both Ukraine and the West, Kyiv and its supporters should explore potential pathways to a ceasefire. An end to the fighting would then clear the way for negotiations about a lasting territorial settlement\u2014ultimately Kyiv\u2019s best option given that Ukraine has a better chance of restoring territorial integrity at the negotiating table than on the battlefield.Lawrence AndersonSenior Fellow, S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (Singapore)Prospects for a Lasting Peace Remain Dim\u00a0Wars end either with one side decisively defeating the other, or both sides, realizing that total victory is unattainable, agreeing to a compromise peace. In the Russia-Ukraine war, neither scenario is imminent as both sides prepare fresh offensives and counteroffensives in 2024.Evidently, President Vladimir Putin still wishes to control all of Ukraine, not just occupy parts of its territory. The good news for Kyiv is that despite the $60 billion in U.S. funding held hostage in Congress, Brussels has provided a timely lifeline with a $54 billion multi-year deal. For the European Union, however, its funding may face turbulence should Donald Trump return to the White House later this year because he will likely press them to provide more aid to Ukraine. The West faces strong pressure from supporters of Ukraine to unlock the sizable Russian foreign reserves immobilized in Western banks to pay for Ukrainian defense and reconstruction.While President Joe Biden continues to support aid to Ukraine, how long this remains U.S. policy is uncertain. More critical theaters, including the war between Israel and Hamas and U.S.-China tensions, are of high priority as well, and will draw military assets away from Ukraine. This is a major factor behind Putin\u2019s recent desire to go on the offensive to secure more territory to better leverage his bargaining position later.A halt to the fighting is possible, but prospects for a lasting peace remain dim. Containing the conflict will require a change in mindsets. It will also entail Ukraine sacrificing some of its territory, not to cede to Russia, but to form part of a demilitarized zone. The other part of the demilitarized zone should comprise adjacent land set aside by Russia. This zone could be patrolled by UN peacekeepers, with Russian and Ukrainian police stationed on their respective sides to assist peacekeepers maintain law and order. \u00a0Preserving Ukraine as a viable, independent, and neutral state will require security arrangements agreed on between the interested parties. Kyiv could pledge, for example, not to join NATO or to station foreign troops on its soil. Ukraine would in effect, assume a status akin to Austria, which is bound to neutrality by the 1955 Austrian State Treaty and its constitution. In return, as a special case, NATO could consider stationing significant assets in nearby member states that could be accessed should hostilities resume. The incentive for Russia in this deal, for a start, would be an end to sanctions and unfreezing its assets in Western financial centers and a return of foreign investments into Moscow. China\u2019s presence as one of the peace-brokers would not only reassure Russia, but Beijing could also provide substantial financial and material aid for the reconstruction of Ukraine\u2019s war-torn territories and infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0 Igor YurgensFormer\u00a0Chair, Institute for Contemporary Development (Russia)The Difficulties of Diplomacy and Clash of Civilizations\u00a0At the start of the third year of the Russia-Ukraine war, it is evident that it is not only a tragic regional conflict but also the clash of civilizations and remaking of the world order, which political scientist Samuel Huntington predicted thirty years ago. The contradiction between a declining West and its model of democracy and surging East and its authoritarian rules can be seen in the east of Europe.The present stage of the conflict is described most frequently as a stalemate and war of attrition.Russia\u2019s size, military-industrial complex, and human and material resources exceed Ukrainian capabilities. The difference might allow Russia to not only maintain its positions in the east and south of Ukraine, but also to go on the offensive.Nevertheless, given the majority of European leaders view Russia as an existential danger, its military and economic assistance to Ukraine will continue to equalize Ukraine\u2019s chances. EU leaders have finally agreed on a funding deal worth more than $50 billion for Ukraine, and a similar U.S. package stuck in Congress will also likely come through.No matter how the conflict ends, a completely satisfactory outcome for Russia cannot be visualized. Relations with the Ukrainians, who were a fraternal nation, will remain antagonistic for a long time. Normal relations with the West, where a significant part of the Russian elite has departed for, will need to be restored at the price of significant concessions. The concept of a separate Eurasian civilization led by Russia is hardly viable in view of the ever-shrinking population, lack of cultural appeal, and growing economic difficulties. It appears that military stalemate provides an opportunity for diplomatic solutions. However, all parties remain dramatically opposed. For Ukraine, the presidential decree formally prohibits negotiations with Russia. For Russia, there are impossible demands for the \u201cdemilitarization, denazification and neutralization of Ukraine,\u201d as well as a ban on Ukraine joining NATO.Informal and formal contacts between intermediaries have not yet led to any results. Many hopes are pinned to the period after the U.S. presidential elections. The year 2024 will see increasing tension and uncertainty.Harsh V. PantVice President for Studies and Foreign Policy, Observer Research Foundation (India)Shairee MalhotraAssociate Fellow for Europe, Observer Research Foundation (India)To End War, Rethink the European Security Architecture\u00a0As the Russia-Ukraine war crosses its two-year mark, both sides along with countries across the globe continue to suffer the devastating consequences of war, yet an end still appears elusive. A military resolution to the war is unlikely given the current stalemate. Both sides have tried various strategies\u2014offensive as well as defensive\u2014without either coming close to a decisive victory. Any sustainable peace needs to be based on the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. A sound strategy implies getting the balance right between ends, ways, and means. That is missing on both sides of the conflict.Rethinking the European security architecture, which is essentially shattered, is fundamentally needed. Therefore, the goal of any political process needs to acknowledge Ukrainian insecurity vis-\u00e0-vis Russia as well as Russian insecurity vis-\u00e0-vis the West. This acknowledgement on both sides needs to guarantee Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity while simultaneously ensuring Russian sensitivities are taken into account by the wider West in the construction of a new security order. This is imperative for a durable resolution, without which tensions are likely to continue to simmer and erupt suddenly and dramatically. Even while stalled militarily, the war is continuing to pile immense pressure on the wider global economy and the world. The Global South demands that the war be resolved as soon as possible to alleviate further suffering. Sustainable resolutions cannot work without taking into account how this war has harmed many poorer and less-developed nations. From their perspective, too, a long-term resolution is vital for the development agenda, which has become a casualty of the war. As India has emphasized, war is not the solution; dialogue and diplomacy will have to play a larger role. Unless a genuine modus vivendi\u2014embedded in a newer security logic, architecture, and perspective for the region\u2014is found between the aspirations and insecurities of both sides, a sustainable resolution will remain elusive. Before further death and destruction take place, Ukraine, Russia, and their allies should seriously think about diplomacy or a political process that involves, at its core, the UN Charter and its principles. Both sides\u2019 priorities should be acknowledged, and the goal should focus on determining a lasting political resolution. This appears the only logical way forward.

Western capitals are struggling to supply funds and ammunition to Kyiv, while the Kremlin seemingly draws on limitless supplies and political support from authoritarian allies and continues to pound Ukrainian cities to rubble. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, says he would \u201cencourage [Russia] to do whatever the hell they want\u201d to NATO allies that spend insufficiently on defense, while Russian President Vladimir Putin threatens Poland and the Baltics in an interview with Tucker Carlson.Six Brookings scholars (Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f, Michael E. O\u2019Hanlon, Steven Pifer, Melanie W. Sisson, Angela Stent, and Tara Varma) debate the questions Ukraine and its supporters now face:Is Russia winning its war against Ukraine? Should the United States and its allies push Ukraine to negotiate with Russia?How can the United States and its allies best ensure security and stability in Ukraine and Europe? Should NATO take further steps toward Ukrainian membership at its 75th-anniversary summit in Washington in July?What concrete steps should the United States and Europe take in 2024 to prevent a Ukrainian defeat? What would the consequences of a Russian victory be for the trans-Atlantic alliance?These are hard questions, with no easy answers; the authors disagree with each other, and some of the disagreements remain unresolved. But the one thing we all agree on is: rarely in living memory has so much been at stake, not just for Ukraine, but for Europe and the Western alliance. And, arguably, for Russia too.\u2013 Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcllerBack to top                      Round I                              Is Russia winning its war against Ukraine? Should the United States and its allies push Ukraine to negotiate with Russia?                          U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy meet during the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 16, 2024. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse      Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015fRussia is not winning in Ukraine\u2014but neither is it losing.Despite early predictions of economic collapse, battlefield exhaustion, and international isolation, Russians have, by and large, managed to muddle through. Economically, the country has avoided a collapse; militarily, it has ramped up weapons production; and diplomatically, in a post-Gaza world, Moscow hardly seems isolated.Meanwhile, the West\u2019s ability to support Ukraine for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d is increasingly looking doubtful to the rest of the world. The U.S. Congress is handwringing on further aid; Europeans are having difficulty in stepping up their military production capabilities to make a difference on the battlefield; the U.S. public is losing its enthusiasm for supporting the war. The Republican presidential front-runner, Donald Trump, is already signaling that he hardly cares about Ukraine or trans-Atlantic unity.Given this harsh reality, we must be honest with ourselves and with Ukrainians. The strategic decisions available for the United States are limited, and not confined to two binary choices: either force Ukraine to negotiate with Russia or declare to support it forever. The real strategic opening is everything in-between, involving compromises, half-measures, and half-baked solutions that last for decades.That\u2019s how wars end\u2014with deeply unsatisfactory results.NATO allies must manifest their support for Ukraine through bilateral security arrangements but not hide that NATO membership is unattainable for now. They should start thinking about how this war ends and encourage Ukraine to be open to cease-fire talks with Russia, even though Russian occupation of parts of Ukraine continues. And more importantly, they should work with Kyiv on the extensive reforms that will anchor Ukraine to the European Union.Michael E. O\u2019HanlonRussia is not winning the war so far. Its original ambitions of taking over Ukraine and unseating its government were stymied. Even its more modest goals of fully controlling five provinces in Ukraine and keeping the country out of Western institutions appear unlikely to succeed over time. That said, war takes unexpected twists and turns. The North was not yet winning the American Civil War at the two-year mark; neither was the Entente in World War I nor were the U.S./U.K./USSR forces in World War II. Russian President Vladimir Putin still hopes to win through a fracturing of Western political will, a depleting of Ukrainian manpower, and what he (wrongly) considers the Russian people\u2019s superior martial virtues and stoicism. He has a high tolerance for other people\u2019s pain and will keep trying.It is too soon to push Ukraine to negotiate. For one thing, there is no other willing party to negotiate with. For another, even if my idea (with Lise Howard) of an alternative security architecture for Ukraine proved acceptable to Moscow, there is no common sense of territorial compromise. (Our idea would envision an Atlantic-Asian Security Committee that oversaw the permanent stationing of numerous Western trainers, including Americans, on Ukrainian soil\u2014partly as a tripwire against Russian aggression\u2014with the additional provision that someday, a post-Putin Russia might be invited to join too. Ukraine understandably wants all its land back; Russia wants at least what it has now (about 17 percent of pre-2014 Ukraine). Someday, we all may have to settle for something like the current status quo as a cease-fire line. But that would be regrettable for the sake of global order and of human decency and is premature. Better that some Ukrainians first come to such an idea themselves, and at least some Russians, too.Steven PiferRussia is not winning. Its military has suffered 315,000 casualties, according to CIA Director William Burns; others place Russian losses at a higher level. In addition, Russia has lost 2,600 main battle tanks, some two-thirds of its modern force, and is having to draw from stocks of 60-year-old tanks. The Russian Navy had to withdraw most of its Black Sea Fleet warships from occupied Crimea. For all that, Russia occupies little more Ukrainian territory than it did at the beginning of 2023 and far less than it did in the first half of 2022. To be sure, Ukraine faces a difficult year in 2024 and will find itself largely on the defensive. However, the past two years have shown how costly, and often how futile, offensive operations can be for the Russians.A key question for Kyiv will be the continuation of European and U.S. support. That can keep Ukraine in the fight. The West should understand what it has at stake: a Kremlin emboldened by victory would pose an even greater threat to Europe.The United States and its allies should not press Ukraine to negotiate. Nothing suggests that Moscow is prepared to discuss anything but its own terms: replacement of the government in Kyiv, demilitarization, neutrality, and acceptance of \u201cgeopolitical realities,\u201d that is, Russia\u2019s absorption of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson\u2014in other words, a capitulation that would leave the remainder of Ukraine open to future assault whenever Moscow chose. Ukrainians will not and should not be expected to accept that. The West should instead provide Kyiv with what it needs to drive the Russian military out and/or secure a settlement on terms Ukraine and Ukrainians can accept.Melanie W. SissonRussia is not winning its war against Ukraine. Experts on post-Soviet Russia\u2019s\u202fuse of force\u202fin its foreign policy explain that Putin\u2019s strategic objective is to prove that there is a\u202fRussian sphere of influence\u202fthat must be accepted and respected. Russia\u2019s war has failed to achieve this in every regard. It has revealed\u202fmore military weaknesses than strengths. It has galvanized Ukrainian nationalism. And it has firmed rather than frayed the West\u2019s attachment to Ukraine. None of this diminishes the importance of Ukraine\u2019s ongoing fight for its rightful territory, but progress in military battles and the war\u2019s outcome should not be conflated.Western leaders and commentators acknowledge as much when calling Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine an attack\u202fon the future of Europe. Although the West continues to\u202fpromise\u202fmaterial support\u202ffor Ukraine\u2019s war effort, it has not yet arrived at a common vision for that European future and for Ukraine\u2019s standing within it.To contend that the United States and its allies should push Ukraine to negotiate with Russia under these terms is unreasonable. Ukrainian decisionmakers can only be expected to negotiate if they believe that continuing the fight is fruitless, or that ending it is a\u202fnecessary step on a plausible path toward a desirable future.\u202fIn the absence of either material exhaustion or confidence that negotiation offers something to gain, it should come as no surprise that Ukrainians will prefer to\u202fcontinue to\u202ffight for what they have\u202fleft\u202fto lose.Angela StentRussia is not winning the war with Ukraine\u202fbut has\u202fmanaged to\u202fcapture\u202fsmall amounts of\u202fUkrainian\u202fterritory since Kyiv\u2019s\u202fdisappointing\u202f2023 counteroffensive. Moscow is conducting a war of attrition with heavy casualties\u202fand\u202fnow has access to\u202fartillery and missiles\u202ffrom\u202fNorth Korea and drones from Iran.\u202fIt will have to continue mobilizing men if it is to launch another offensive\u202fin 2024. Ukraine is not winning the war either and will focus on defense in 2024, perhaps launching another counteroffensive in 2025.\u202fIt has recently been attacking inside Russian territory and bombing energy facilities.\u202fHowever, if U.S. financial assistance and weapons\u202fdry up\u202fin 2024, this would increase Russia\u2019s chances of defeating Ukraine, even if Europe provides financial assistance and more advanced weapons.The United States\u202fand its allies should not push Ukraine\u202fto negotiate with Russia.\u202fThe Kremlin has shown no interest in negotiations unless Ukraine accepts the incorporation of four \u201cannexed\u201d territories into Russia\u2014territories that Russia does not fully control.\u202fPutin still says that the goal of his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d is to \u201cdenazify\u201d (i.e., regime change) and demilitarize Ukraine and ensure that it ceases to exist as a country.\u202fUkraine is fighting an existential war for its survival as an independent, sovereign state.\u202fEven if there were a temporary\u202fcease-fire,\u202fRussia would likely regroup\u202fand\u202frelaunch hostilities. Serious negotiations can\u202fonly\u202fbegin if Russia moderates its war aims.\u202fBut\u202fPutin is betting on elections in the United States and Europe\u202fbringing\u202fto power leaders who will no longer support\u202fUkraine.Tara VarmaTwo years into the war, the good news is that Russia isn\u2019t winning\u2014at least not in terms of what a decisive victory would be: clear military advantage leading Moscow to win over Ukrainian territory, which is one of its\u202fkey objectives. One should note that Russian\u202fself-avowed goals\u202fin Ukraine have evolved since the invasion in 2022, though Putin\u202finsists they remain the same, namely \u201cdenazification, demilitarization and [Ukraine\u2019s] neutral status.\u201d The\u202finitial full-scale\u202finvasion stemming both from the east and the north indicated a willingness not only to take Kyiv but actually the whole of Ukraine.The not-so-good news coming from Kyiv is that the\u202fcounteroffensive\u202flaunched in the summer of 2023 hasn\u2019t delivered the expected result of taking back Russian-occupied territory in the east. The strain on the Ukrainian army and population is enormous\u2014but so is the responsibility of the United States and Europe to keep providing Ukraine with the weapons and funds it needs. While\u202fU.S. support\u202fis being weaponized in the context of the 2024 presidential campaign,\u202fEurope cannot afford a similar situation to happen. It has an existential interest in Ukraine\u202fprevailing\u202fin the war and has approved\u202faccession negotiations\u202ffor Ukraine into the European Union. Americans and Europeans have also been resolute and\u202fclear\u202fthat it is for Ukraine to set the terms of negotiations and/or victory. While the West supports them diplomatically, financially, militarily, and materially, Ukrainians are the ones on the frontlines and must remain the sole decision-makers on future steps.Back to top                      Round II                              How can the United States and its allies best ensure security and stability in Ukraine and Europe? Should NATO take further steps toward Ukrainian membership at its 75th-anniversary summit in Washington in July?                          Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg walk on the day of a NATO Defence Ministers' meeting at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium October 11, 2023. REUTERS/Johanna Geron      Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015fThe best way for the United States and allies to ensure stability and security in Ukraine is to provide the assistance necessary for Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression\u2014now and in future years.One can imagine several mechanisms for providing that assistance, from purely bilateral and ad-hoc assistance, as in recent years, through more formal bilateral arrangements, such as the recently concluded treaties between the U.K. and Ukraine, all the way toward partial or full NATO membership.The question of which arrangement\u2014or which combination of arrangements\u2014will best serve the needs of Ukraine, the United States, and their allies remains an open one. The NATO summit is an important opportunity to explore that question and to feel out the NATO allies\u2019 various views.At the same time, it will be important not to confuse the question of NATO membership with the necessity of helping Ukraine defend itself. It is but one mechanism for doing that, and not necessarily the best one. It is doubtful that the membership path will militarily deter Russia, which claims it is already fighting a NATO-backed power. The question is also certain to create divisions within the alliance at a critical time, as powerful member states like Germany and the United States are reluctant to walk down that path.The United States and its allies should explore all avenues to support Ukraine, all the while recognizing their long-term interest in promoting security and stability in Ukraine.Michael E. O\u2019HanlonI believe that it is too soon to say whether NATO membership for Ukraine will provide the best path forward for ending this terrible war on acceptable terms for the people of Ukraine and preventing future attacks by Russia against Ukraine even after this war is over. Therefore, I oppose new binding steps toward NATO membership for Ukraine this coming July.Ukraine deserves an anchor in Western security institutions as soon as possible. However, insisting that NATO be the vehicle or architecture ensures non-negotiability with Moscow. (Please check out CIA director and former U.S. ambassador to Russia Bill Burns\u2019s memoir for a similar view.)NATO has not threatened Russia and will not. Moscow\u2019s claims to the contrary are specious. But Putin and many other Russian hardliners believe otherwise\u2014even if they do not really think that NATO will invade Russia, they fear the precedent of \u201ccolored revolutions\u201d and resent the Western alliance system\u2019s encroachment into a space they consider crucial to Russia\u2019s security. They are also often petty and vindictive in their worldviews. These facts do not justify Russia\u2019s heinous attack against Ukraine. Yet they should nonetheless inform our strategic calculus going forward.With Lise Howard of Georgetown, I have proposed an alternative security architecture for Eastern Europe that would, among other things, put U.S. boots on the ground in Ukraine indefinitely, as a form of tripwire and deterrent. An idea like that should remain in the mix for now. I believe it is more likely to help stabilize the situation in the Russia-Ukraine region than would a tentative, slow-motion path to NATO membership.Steven PiferThe immediate need is for the United States and its allies to sustain the flow of arms to help Ukraine prevail, as G7 and other countries agreed at and since last July\u2019s NATO summit in Vilnius.\u202fIn the longer term, Russia\u2019s actions have shredded the existing European security system.\u202fThe successor to that system will have to focus on containing and defending against Russia, at least until the Kremlin adopts a different approach toward its neighbors.\u202fUkraine needs to be a part of that system. A Ukraine left on its own, even if armed by its Western partners, would still pose a tempting target for further Kremlin aggression.There is no consensus within NATO now for extending Ukraine a membership invitation.\u202fThe allies should instead use the alliance\u2019s 75th-anniversary summit in Washington to initiate accession talks with Kyiv, with a view to extending an early invitation to join.\u202fIt will be easier for NATO to bring Ukraine in when the current war is over than while the fighting is ongoing.\u202fOnce Ukraine is a member, the onus for new hostilities would rest with Moscow, and the Kremlin would have to calculate the risks and costs of going to war against NATO as well as Ukraine.\u202fIn the meantime, launching accession talks would put Ukraine on a definitive path to membership, bolster morale in Kyiv, and signal NATO\u2019s long-term commitment to Moscow.\u202fIf at some point Ukraine\u2019s leadership decides to negotiate, accession talks would strengthen its bargaining hand.Melanie W. SissonThe West needs to make clear to Ukraine, even if only privately, that NATO membership will not be offered at any time in the foreseeable future. The security and stability of Ukraine are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for the security and stability of Europe. Were it otherwise, Ukraine would have become a NATO member a long time ago.Yet Western leaders very much have framed the war in these terms, effectively entangling efforts to end the war with efforts to design a new security architecture for the whole of the European continent. Doing so, together with ongoing promises of material support, suggests to Ukraine that if it continues to fight then it will gain the benefits of entry into a newly architected West. Yet the currently architected West provides Ukraine with no concrete information about what those benefits will be and when, even roughly, it can expect to receive them. Far from helping to put Ukrainian leaders in the strongest possible position at the bargaining table, the West\u2019s strategic confusion is instead impeding the process of getting to the table at all.If U.S. and European leaders believe there is a need for a new continental security architecture, then by all means they should set about designing one. But that matter needs to be addressed apart from working with Ukraine to devise a postwar relationship that increases its probability of being a lasting, autonomous state. This is what the military fight is now about\u2014not the future of Europe, but the future of Ukraine. It should be treated as such.Angela StentRussia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine showed that deterrence failed, despite Western warnings to Putin prior to February 24, 2022, of the consequences of launching a war. The Western alliance\u2019s key challenge going forward is creating a more effective deterrent against Russian aggression. So far, Russia has not attacked any NATO member, indicating that the Kremlin understands that NATO would invoke Article 5 and counterattack. As long as Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine continues, the United States and its allies should continue arming Ukraine and supporting it financially to enable it to continue fighting. NATO countries should also follow the U.K.\u2019s lead in concluding bilateral security agreements with Kyiv.Once the war is over, the United States and its allies will face the difficult question of whether it is possible to rebuild a Euro-Atlantic security system that includes Russia. As long as Putin, or a successor who shares his worldview and desire to recreate the Russian Empire, is in power, it will not be possible to include Russia. In the longer run, under a different leadership, it may be feasible. In the meantime, the best way to ensure security and stability in Europe is to redouble the containment strategy that worked during the Cold War and to support Ukraine\u2019s integration into European structures.If Ukraine had been a NATO member in 2022, Russia would not have invaded. Even though NATO membership cannot happen while the war rages, Ukraine deserves a path to membership. The Washington summit should discuss a road map that provides Ukraine with concrete guidelines and milestones toward membership.Tara VarmaThe United States and Europe have an intrinsic interest in Ukraine winning this war. Funding to support Ukraine militarily and economically has to be secured on both sides of the Atlantic. Discussions are ongoing in the U.S. House of Representatives. The White House has reiterated its belief that a supplemental package on national security would be passed. This package is expected to provide $60 billion to support Ukraine\u2019s defensive war against Russia.\u202fThe EU finally passed its $54 billion aid package during the last European Council meeting. Last December, the EU decided to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, thus intertwining Ukraine and Europe\u2019s futures. With integration will come societal, economic, and judicial reforms that will further foster the resilience of Ukraine and its people.\u202fThe United States explicitly indicated that it, too, would be safer with a stable Ukraine being a full member of Euro-Atlantic institutions.NATO is on the verge of adding one new member, Sweden, after Finland last year. Last July, the NATO secretary-general said that member countries had agreed Ukraine would eventually join the alliance once the war is over. While the war is ongoing, absent the membership proposal,\u202fseveral European countries, including the U.K., Germany, and soon France, have committed to providing security guarantees to Kyiv. France and the U.K., the two European nuclear powers, should go beyond financial commitments and offer to provide Kyiv with a bilateral nuclear umbrella, thus outlining the beginnings of a new European security order.Back to top                      Round III                              What concrete steps should the United States and Europe take in 2024 to prevent a Ukrainian defeat? What would the consequences of a Russian victory be for the trans-Atlantic alliance?                          Ursula von der Leyen at a joint press conference briefing with Charles Michel President of the European Council, after the end of the Extraordinary Special European Council Summit, the EU leaders meeting at the headquarters of the European Union. Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto.      Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015fA Russian victory in Ukraine would have significant implications for European security\u2014with ripple effects in wider Europe and even parts of the Middle East. It would make countries on NATO\u2019s eastern flank even more anxious about their long-term security\u2014leading them to seek greater U.S. assurances to compensate for waning faith in NATO\u2019s credibility\u2014while encouraging Russia to be more assertive in the Black Sea, the Baltics, and the Eastern Mediterranean.But the more dramatic impact would be on the political front. Russia\u2019s victory would be viewed in the Global South as NATO\u2019s defeat, reinforcing the Russian propaganda that the West is in terminal decline and a new world order is emerging. From India to the Middle East, the United States and allies would pay a hefty price for the erosion of prestige. Middle powers would be more dismissive of what is left of the rules-based order, eyeing transactional deals with Moscow and Beijing to expand their regional agendas. In Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, and Bosnia, pro-Western sentiments would be crushed by heavy-handed Russian political meddling. Elsewhere, hedging would be the name of the game.Inside Europe and the United States, political fragmentation and populist surge would accelerate in an age of self-doubt.The way to prevent this scenario is to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression while seeking openings to end the war in a way that preserves Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and long-term sustainability. Ukraine must be in the best negotiating position when the war winds down, but more importantly, it must not be this conflict\u2019s loser.That depends on us, as much as it does on Ukrainians.Michael E. O\u2019HanlonIt is too soon to lower expectations for what the United States and allies are doing to help Ukraine. We should pour it on through 2024, providing virtually all the types of weaponry Ukraine may request over the next 15-to-18 months, with the hope that Ukraine can break the military logjam sometime this year or early next. Part of the case for additional patience is that it typically takes modern military units at least a couple of years to absorb and train on new weapons. Ukraine has not yet had a fair chance to do so.However, I would distinguish my approach from U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s vow to help Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes.\u201d The United States should plan to reassess its strategy in 2025, as would be expected for a major national security issue early in the new term of a just-elected president (whether Biden or Trump or someone else). If the war remains largely stalemated then, a fallback approach should be considered. It would presumably center on the ideas of helping Ukraine protect whatever territory it then holds, recover economically, strengthen its defenses for the future, and be anchored to Western institutions. But it is too soon to accept territorial compromise now, or to pressure Ukraine to do so\u2014and in the process to reward Russia at least partially for its aggression.Russia is a long way from winning this war outright; Ukraine has defeated the majority of Russia\u2019s most ambitious goals already. But if somehow Russia does conquer Ukraine or overthrow its government, NATO would have to assume that its own eastern-frontier countries were also in danger. That would be an extremely fraught outcome for future U.S. and Western security policy, while substantially raising the risk that we could ourselves be at war with Russia in the future.Steven PiferUkraine will be largely on the defensive for much of 2024. The first priority is to provide the Ukrainians with as many artillery shells and air defense systems as possible. Second, the United States and Germany should send longer-range ATACMS and Taurus missiles, enabling Kyiv to strike logistics, command, and other targets anywhere in Russian-occupied Ukraine. Third, the West should help Ukraine build forces for future offensive operations.At home, the United States and Europe must expand their defense production capabilities, both to assist Ukraine and rearm their militaries. To increase pressure on Moscow, the West should threaten and, if necessary, sanction third countries that transfer Western high-tech products to Russia. It should also take steps to reduce the revenues Russia receives for its oil and gas exports by, for example, shutting down Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of oil tankers that evade the G7 oil price cap.Were Russia to defeat Ukraine, NATO would have to worry about what an emboldened Putin might do after digesting the victory and rebuilding the Russian armed forces. Would his ambitions extend to Moldova or even the Baltic states, all once part of the Russian Empire? NATO would have to increase its defense spending and military presence on its eastern flank. While most analysts discount Russian military action against a NATO member such as Lithuania, most analysts five years ago would have ruled out the possibility of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. It would be a mistake to underestimate Putin\u2019s ambitions, particularly given his knack for miscalculation.Melanie W. SissonThe United States and Europe should not seek \u201cdefeat\u201d or \u201cvictory\u201d for either Russia or Ukraine. Doing so is a formula for prolonging the violence. It is also paralyzing the development of a strategy for the relationships Western countries\u2014individually and together\u2014are willing to have with both belligerents in the future.U.S. and European strategy must instead be designed to provide Ukraine with the information it needs to decide when to seek negotiations, and which compromises it is, and is not, willing to make at the table. This will require the United States and countries in Europe and Asia to work with Ukraine on plans for Ukraine\u2019s economic reconstruction. These should not be premised on EU accession; the process is too long, and the outcome too uncertain. The West also will need to make decisions about how to structure ongoing defense cooperation. This should not be premised on ensuring Ukraine\u2019s long-term security against another Russian attack; meeting this standard is impossible, and it is not necessary to establish near-term stability.The United States and Europe must also try to shape Russia\u2019s incentives to negotiate. Calibrated sanctions relief, clarity that Ukraine will not be a NATO member at any time in the foreseeable future\u2014even if communicated only privately\u2014and signals that Russia will be part of the continent\u2019s future security architecture are all viable means of doing so. The United States and Europe should not allow their distaste for these options, and their loathing of Putin, to come at the expense of Ukraine getting to a better future, faster.Angela StentThe most important, concrete steps that the alliance can take to prevent a Ukrainian defeat are to keep supplying Ukraine with the money and weapons it needs to continue fighting Russia. The European Council has finally managed to overcome Hungary\u2019s veto and has voted to provide Kyiv with nearly $54 billion over the next four years. This will enable the Ukrainian government to continue functioning and to pay pensions. Europeans are also supplying some weapons, although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has vetoed the export of Taurus missiles, thus depriving Ukraine of a much-needed means to combat Russian air superiority. But the United States is the key country for weapons and funding. The U.S. Senate passed a bill on February 12 approving $95 billion in assistance for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and Taiwan, having separated the Ukraine assistance from the border security provisions in the initial supplemental bill. Seventy Senators voted in favor, including many Republicans. However, the bill faces an uncertain fate in the House, where MAGA Republicans are determined not to fund Ukraine. If the U.S. House fails to pass the supplemental bill that would provide $60 billion to Ukraine and if the most advanced weapons like the F-16 fighters do not arrive in the quantity that Ukraine needs, then the consequences for Ukraine would be very serious. Congress\u2019s failure to pass the bill could hasten Ukraine\u2019s defeat.A Russian victory would shake the alliance to the core. Once Russia has recovered and rearmed, it could well set its sights further West, threatening the Baltic states and Poland. A Russian victory could lead NATO to redouble its containment strategy and seek to find enhanced ways to deter Russia from further aggression. Alternatively, a Russian win might lead to greater fissures within the alliance, with states like Hungary, Slovakia, Greece, Spain, and Italy reconsidering their relationship with Russia and whether they need to accommodate it more going forward.Tara VarmaThe consequences of a Russian victory in Ukraine cannot be overstated: it would shatter the current European security order for good and convince Putin of our weakness and powerlessness to defend our interests. In addition to Ukraine falling, with dramatic consequences for its population, the rest of Europe and possibly NATO member states would be at risk of an attack by an emboldened Putin. An insecure Europe is not in the United States\u2019 interest\u2014politically, economically, militarily, or otherwise. Other rival powers would also draw their own conclusions from such a development.In 2024, the United States and Europe must reaffirm their long-term, sustained support of Ukraine through the increase of financial, humanitarian, material, and military aid. The European Council\u2019s February 1 decision to grant $54 billion in aid is welcome. But Europe and the United States have to go beyond that and accompany Ukraine in the next phases of the war as Putin relentlessly continues to attack the country. Burden-sharing will be on the agenda at the Washington NATO summit. The summit provides an opportunity for reinforced\u202fEU-NATO cooperation. Indeed, there is scope for NATO and the EU to better coordinate their efforts to ramp up\u202fdefense production in Europe. The complementarity between the two is clear: NATO is the go-to coordinating forum and the EU is endowed with financial instruments and the industrial toolbox that can incentivize defense industries in Europe.This should be our priority as we seek to protect Ukraine and provide it with all the equipment and assistance it needs. A strong and stable Ukraine is in Europe\u2019s and the United States\u2019 interests.AuthorsIntroductionConstanze Stelzenm\u00fcllerDirector - Center on the United States and Europe,Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center on the United States and Europe,Fritz Stern Chair on Germany and Trans-Atlantic Relations             @ConStelz          ContributorsAsl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015fVisiting Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center on the United States and Europe, The Turkey Project            @asliaydintasbas          Michael E.

GONZALO FUENTES / AP   Emmanuel Macron unveiled on Monday, February 26, a series of initiatives aimed at fortifying Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian invasion, suggesting that even the deployment of Western ground forces remained a possibility in the pursuit of Europe's objective to counter Moscow. Russia, he said, was showing a \"more aggressive attitude not just in Ukraine but in general,\" adding \"We firmly believe that Russia's defeat is pivotal for Europe's security and stability.\" While there was \"no consensus\" on the sending of Western ground troops to Ukraine, \"no option should be discarded. We will spare no effort to ensure that Russia does not emerge victorious in this conflict.\"  Read more Subscribers only Ukraine's allies divided over potential ground intervention raised by Macron    Macron said a new coalition would be set up to supply Ukraine with \"medium and long-range missiles and bombs for strategic strikes,\" adding there was a \"broad consensus to do more and quicker.\" He added: \"Every avenue must be explored to achieve our goal. Russia cannot triumph in this war.\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov offered a muted initial reaction on Tuesday, saying that sending Western troops to Ukraine was \"absolutely not in the interests of these countries, they should be aware of this.\" Russia 'hardening' The conference convened approximately 25 European heads of state and government, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Polish President Andrzej Duda. The United States and Canada were also represented. Macron said earlier, as he opened the conference at the Elys\u00e9e Palace, that Ukraine's allies needed to jump-start their support as the war entered its third year. \"We have seen hardening on the part of Russia, especially these past few months,\" Macron said. He said this had manifested itself in the February 16 death in custody of President Vladimir Putin's top opponent Alexei Navalny, but also in a hardening of Russia's positions on the frontlines, where it was planning \"new attacks.\"  Read more Subscribers only Two years of war in Ukraine: Zelensky calls to 'unite for a common victory'    Macron stressed the necessity for Western nations to adopt a more proactive approach, one that \"acknowledges the evolving threat from both military and strategic perspectives.\" The conference served as a platform for Macron to position himself as a leading advocate for Ukraine within Europe, amidst concerns that American backing could wane in the coming months. \"Together we must ensure that Putin cannot destroy our achievements and cannot expand his aggression to other nations,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a brief video message to the conference. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Zelensky had said that European leaders realized \"how dangerous\" the war is for \"the whole of Europe\". 'Clear message' Western officials acknowledge that Russia risks gaining the upper hand in the conflict this year as Ukraine runs out of weapons and ammunition. Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov lamented on Sunday that half of the Western military aid pledged to Kyiv arrives late, cautioning that \"commitment does not equate to delivery.\" A French presidential official, speaking anonymously, emphasized the importance of countering any perception of disarray following Ukraine's recent setbacks on the battlefield. \"We aim to send a resolute message to Putin that he will not prevail in Ukraine,\" the official asserted.

Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia again put the cause of the war down to the failure to implement the 2015 Minsk agreements, which he blamed on \u201cKyiv\u2019s sabotage\u201d supported by the West.The agreements aimed to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia-backed separatists that flared in April 2014 after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatists in the mostly Russian-speaking industrial east called Donbas.At Monday\u2019s Security Council meeting that Russia called on the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Minsk peace plan brokered by France and Germany, Nebenzia called claims by Ukraine and Western nations that Russia refused to implement the agreements \u201cabsolutely baseless.\u201dFrance accuses Russia of a disinformation campaign in a key election yearRussia launches barrage of 45 drones over Ukraine as Kyiv changes more military leadersWhat\u2019s inside the Senate\u2019s $95 billion bill to aid Ukraine and Israel and counter ChinaHad the Minsk agreements been implemented, Nebenzia said, \u201cthe tragedy that has taken place in Ukraine today would not have happened, a tragedy in which the U.S. and the collective West are complicit as they try to achieve their geopolitical aims at the cost of Ukraine and the lives of its citizens.\u201dU.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood accused Russia of putting forward \u201csignificant myths and disinformation\u201d in its efforts to rewrite history after it invaded a sovereign nation in violation of the U.N. Charter.\u201cMoscow has called us together today to lament the very violence it began, fueled and it continues to perpetrate daily,\u201d he said.Wood told the council Russia negotiated and signed the Minsk agreements but \u201cignored all commitments it made.\u201d\u201cIt is Russia that is the aggressor and Ukraine which is simply defending its people, its territorial integrity and its freedom,\u201d the U.S. envoy said.Wood said Russia trained the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine as \u201ca proxy force to undermine Ukraine\u2019s stability,\u201d and said the war and Putin\u2019s recognition of the independence as so-called independent entities \u201chave fully and forever nullified the Minsk agreements.\u201dBritain\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador James Kariuki said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine showed the world that Putin \u201cwas never interested in peace.\u201dHe accused Russia of using the council meeting \u201cin another attempt to distort history\u201d and a desperate effort to justify its \u201cunprovoked, unnecessary and illegal\u201d invasion and ongoing war.\u201cWe urge Russia once again to end its illegal invasion, withdraw from Ukraine and respect the principles of the U.N. Charter, Kariuki said, vowing that the United Kingdom will continue to stand with Ukraine and call out \u201cRussian disinformation.\u201dThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

LAURENCE GEAI/MYOP FOR LE MONDE   The demographic crisis is here to stay. Two years after the start of the massive Russian-led invasion, Ukraine's population is continuing to decline, with no immediate hope of reversing the trend. The country's population is currently estimated to be between 33 and 35 million, but no precise count can be done due to the Russian military occupation of 20% of its territory. The lowest estimate, 33.7 million, comes from the International Monetary Fund, while official Ukrainian statistics cited 35 million on January 1, 2024 \u2013 an exact count \"to within 200,000 individuals,\" according to Oleksandr Gladun, deputy director of the Ptoukha Institute of Demography and Social Sciences. This number encompasses Ukrainians living within the internationally recognized 1991 borders, in other words including Crimea, and the regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson still occupied by the Russian army. But the number falls to only 31.1 million if the count is limited to residents within the territory remaining under Ukrainian government control. Ukraine is losing people in many ways: Soldiers killed or missing at the front, civilian victims of bombings, soldiers taken prisoner, forced population displacements in areas occupied by the Russian army, children separated from their parents and sent to Russia \u2013 not to mention the 6 million Ukrainian civilians, mainly women and children, who have left the country. Indeed, the longer the conflict goes on, the greater the likelihood that exiles will settle in their host country.

The last census was carried out in March 2001, and the Ukrainian government has been repeatedly postponing this politically explosive exercise ever since. Gravediggers work without end To this day, one of the great unknowns remains the number of Ukrainian servicemen killed in combat. Forced to wage an existential struggle against a numerically superior aggressor who does not shy away from any war crime, the Ukrainian state had chosen to keep its military losses quiet to reduce the demoralizing effect on the population, particularly on men of fighting age. All men aged between 18 and 60 are forbidden to leave the country.

Every day brings its share of mourning announcements on social media. In every cemetery, gravediggers have been unendingly digging out the shapes of fresh graves topped with the two-tone blue and yellow flag, in tribute to fallen soldiers.

Facing the imminent collapse of NATO\u2019s Ukrainian proxy forces amid massive losses, the summit was called to lay the groundwork for the introduction of troops from NATO and EU member countries to fight Russia in Ukraine.Before the summit, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico warned, \u201cNATO and EU member states are considering that they will send their troops to Ukraine on a bilateral basis.\u201d He added, \u201cI cannot say for what purpose.\u201dThese warnings were confirmed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who declared last night that \u201ceverything is possible\u201d to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine, and that individual European countries sending troops to Ukraine is \u201cnot excluded.\u201dHe pledged to give Ukraine \u201cmedium- and long-range missiles and bombs\u201d for use against Russia. That is, Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other top EU officials agreed to the framework for a full-scale EU-NATO war against Russia.The statements of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke to the Paris conference via video link, epitomize the official lying aiming to obscure the catastrophic implications of this EU-NATO escalation. \u201c31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died in this war,\u201d Zelensky claimed. \u201cNot 300,000 or 150,000, or whatever Putin and his lying circle are saying. But each of these losses is a great loss for us.\u201dZelensky\u2019s statement exposes his contempt for the Ukrainian people, who know he is lying. If the NATO powers are now advocating sending their own troops to the battlefield, it is because so many Ukrainian soldiers have been killed that the Ukrainian army has run out of manpower.In November 2022, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said 100,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed or wounded, though the New York Times wrote that \u201cofficials said privately the numbers were closer to 120,000.\u201d Last August, the Times cited US officials claiming Ukraine had lost 70,000 killed and 120,000 wounded.The SEP launches its campaign for a socialist alternative in 2024 to Biden and Trump, the corporate candidates of war and dictatorship!David North, the national chairman of the Socialist Equality Party (US) announced today the selection of Joe Kishore and Jerry White as its candidates in the 2024 presidential election campaign.US officials critical of the Ukraine war and with access to classified intelligence reports said these August 2023 figures in fact understated Ukrainian losses, so as to limit opposition to the war.US Colonel Douglas Macgregor said, \u201cThe Ukrainians now, we think, have lost 400,000 men killed in battle. We were talking about 300,000-350,000 a few months ago. Within the last month of this supposed counteroffensive which was to sweep the battlefield, they lost at least 40,000 killed.\u201dUkrainian casualties today are far higher than they were last August. Indeed, Ukraine\u2019s failed \u201ccounteroffensive\u201d\u2014which involved throwing troops against well-prepared Russian fortifications backed by mines, heavy artillery and drones\u2014was not called off until November. Ukrainian forces have since suffered catastrophic defeats all along the front line, most recently abandoning Avdeevka amid reports they were suffering 1,500 casualties per day.A recent Washington Post report on the Ukrainian front found several infantry battalions with only 40 of 200 men left. One battalion commander warned the Post that \u201cthe front will collapse somewhere.\u201dUkraine\u2019s catastrophic casualties are a warning: Other European countries will also take horrific losses if they wage war on Russia. It is worth recalling the September 2023 study in the US Army War College Quarterly, which called on the United States to reinstate the draft so as to be able to absorb the losses it would suffer in a war with Russia. It projected that the US Army would take 3,600 casualties per day, or 1.3 million per year, in this looming war.Moreover, the deaths and casualties will not be confined to the battlefield. The direct introduction of NATO forces into the war against Russia would almost certainly escalate into a nuclear conflict, with deaths and casualties running into the tens and hundreds of millions.If Zelensky lies so brazenly about the number of war dead, what else are he and his NATO allies lying about? The answer is: Everything.The entire narrative the NATO powers have concocted around the Ukraine war, to justify plans for military escalation worked out behind the backs of the population, is a tissue of lies that must be rejected. Workers and youth must instead be politically mobilized to stop the war.US and European ruling circles lie relentlessly about the origins of the Ukraine war, claiming it is a case of unprovoked Russian aggression. But this weekend, the New York Times, to justify its call for the US Congress to pass legislation providing $60 billion in additional military aid to Ukraine, published an article detailing how Ukraine serves as a valuable asset for CIA spying and assassination programs against Russia. \u201cThe details of this intelligence partnership, many of which are being disclosed by the New York Times for the first time, have been a closely guarded secret for a decade,\u201d it wrote.Thus, the \u201cclosely guarded secret\u201d of complicit US and European media is that NATO provoked the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Since the 2014 US-backed coup in Kiev that installed Ukraine\u2019s current regime, the NATO powers have spent tens and hundreds of billions of dollars to build up Ukraine as a military base. The bankrupt post-Soviet capitalist regime in Russia invaded Ukraine as an essentially defensive maneuver, trying to pressure what it calls its \u201cWestern partners,\u201d that is, the NATO imperialist powers, to drop their most aggressive policies against Russia.Since the Stalinist bureaucracy dissolved the Soviet Union in 1991, the NATO powers have waged wars across the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa, killing millions. This bloody rampage enabled the NATO powers to plunder the world, while imposing social austerity and strengthening the military-police state against the workers at home.The disintegration of the Ukrainian front comes under conditions where the lies used to justify these wars are deeply discredited. The Iraqi \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d Washington invoked as a pretext to invade oil-rich Iraq in 2003 did not exist. The NATO wars launched in Libya and Syria in 2011, supposedly to defend democracy against authoritarian regimes tied to Russia, have been followed by the NATO powers\u2019 backing for Israel\u2019s genocide against Gaza. Amid growing social anger and strikes against inflation and austerity, mass protests against the Gaza genocide are unfolding in America, Europe and internationally.The European ruling class is reacting to this crisis by shifting far to the right. Fearing that a Ukrainian defeat would blow apart the entire edifice of lies used to justify its imperialist wars abroad and class war at home, it has opened a path for World War III to explode across Europe and the world.The way forward for the working class, as the ruling class turns to global war, is a turn to an international, revolutionary perspective. The urgent task, amid growing strikes against inflation and austerity and mass international opposition to the Gaza genocide, is to build an international anti-war movement based in the working class and fighting for socialism.The World Socialist Web Site is the voice of the working class and the leadership of the international socialist movement.

Sergei Supinsky/AFP/Getty ImagesArticleCurrent political and economic issues succinctly explained.Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine is about to enter its third year. There is much to feel good about, but there are also grounds for worry. In short, it is time to take stock.What Ukraine and its Western backers have accomplished in the wake of Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion is extraordinary. Russia, a nuclear-armed power with three and a half times the population of Ukraine, ten times the GDP, and a military with many times the personnel and equipment, has been fought to something close to a draw. Ukraine controls some 80% of its territory, much as it did two years ago.More on:UkraineThe War in UkraineU.S. CongressChinaRussian President Vladimir Putin obviously calculated that his war of conquest would resemble his previous invasion of Ukraine in 2014, when Russian forces swept in and quickly seized Crimea and much of the eastern Donbas region. He saw Ukraine, Europe, and the United States as weak and divided. He also believed his generals when they promised that Russia\u2019s military was strong and would overwhelm whatever resistance Ukraine could muster.The World This WeekA weekly digest of the latest\u00a0from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

But there is reason to be concerned nonetheless.Ukraine\u2019s highly anticipated counter-offensive, designed to liberate territory and deliver a battlefield win or at least momentum that would set the stage for promising diplomacy, was largely rebuffed. Russia has learned to live with Western economic sanctions and has largely rerouted vital energy exports to China and India.Western military sanctions have likewise been evaded: Russia has continued to sell weapons to India and others and buy them from North Korea and Iran. It has also been able to purchase ostensibly civilian technology and products that can be repurposed for military use. It has expanded its defense industrial base and now has a sizeable advantage over Ukraine in the quantity of artillery and ammunition that it can deliver to the battlefield.Russia shows few signs of exhaustion. Despite the extraordinary human toll of the war, estimated to be more than 300,000 Russian troops killed or injured, Putin\u2019s control of the media and public narrative has allowed the Kremlin to minimize dissent and persuade many Russians that their country is the victim rather than an aggressor.More on:UkraineThe War in UkraineU.S. CongressChinaMeanwhile, Ukraine is showing signs of political division. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky just fired his top general. More important, Ukraine is struggling on the battlefield, largely owing to Republicans in the US Congress blocking a $60 billion military assistance package. Republican opposition appears to reflect a mixture of resurgent isolationism, sympathy for the authoritarianism of Putin, and a partisan desire not to hand President Joe Biden a political victory before the presidential election in November.Ideally, Biden will be able to convince enough Republicans to work with him and fellow Democrats to approve a new tranche of assistance, which is in America\u2019s strategic interest. But this outcome cannot be counted on, despite growing evidence that Ukraine is running short of arms and ammunition and, as a result, experiencing mounting difficulty in standing up to Russian military pressure.This raises the question: How might Ukraine and its friends in Europe and elsewhere fill at least some of the void left by a US no longer prepared to offer significant levels of assistance?Europe has already agreed to provide Ukraine with more than $50 billion in new economic aid; together with others (such as South Korea and possibly Japan), a coordinated plan is also needed to provide Ukraine with arms and ammunition so it can better defend itself and strike important Russian military targets. At the same time, Ukraine\u2019s friends must help it reconstitute and expand its arms industry, so that it becomes less dependent on the ability and willingness of others to provide the resources the war effort requires.At the same time, Ukraine can reduce its resource needs and save lives by adopting a largely defensive military strategy. Protecting and preserving the 80% of the country Ukraine now controls is feasible and essential. Ukraine would not be giving up anything by embracing such a posture, given that military liberation of Crimea, Donbas, and other Russian-occupied areas is not in the cards, at least in the short term. And it can continue to seek full territorial restitution at the negotiating table if and when serious talks commence.If the provision of arms will determine how Ukraine fares this year, the US presidential and congressional elections in November will go a long way toward determining how it fares in 2025 and beyond. If Biden is re-elected, and if the US Senate flips to Republican control, as many expect, but the Democrats retake the House of Representatives, then the stage will be set for renewed US economic and military aid and possibly a tie between Ukraine and NATO. This would disabuse Putin of the view that time is on his side, in turn increasing the odds that diplomacy would come to the fore.If, however, former President Donald Trump wins and the Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives, Ukraine will face a far more difficult future. The burden of Ukraine\u2019s security would fall even more on itself and its friends in Europe and Asia. If they prove willing and able to fill much of the gap left by a withdrawal of US support, one could envision a prolonged stalemate on the battlefield followed by constructive diplomacy. If not, Putin would be likely to press his advantage on the battlefield and come to the negotiating table only to impose the outcome he has sought from the beginning.The difference between these two futures is stark. The stakes for Ukraine, for Europe, and for the world are enormous. Chinese President Xi Jinping, with his own designs on Taiwan, is watching with keen interest how this plays out. So, too, is Iran. If the US proves unwilling to meet its obligations and uphold the rule of international law that territory may not be acquired by force, we are looking at a future far more violent and dangerous than the past.Creative Commons      Creative Commons: Some rights reserved.

The 71-year-old Russian leader spent more than 20 minutes showering a baffled Carlson with dates and names going back to the ninth century.Putin even gave him a folder containing what he said were copies of historical documents proving his points: that Ukrainians and Russians historically have always been one people, and that Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty is merely an illegitimate holdover from the Soviet era. Russian soldiers march toward Red Square to attend a dress rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade in Moscow, Russia, Sunday, May 7, 2023. (AP Photo, File)Carlson said he was \u201cshocked\u201d at being on the receiving end of the history lesson. But for those familiar with Putin\u2019s government, it was not surprising in the least: In Russia, history has long been a propaganda tool used to advance the Kremlin\u2019s political goals. And the last two years have been entirely in keeping with that ethos. In an effort to rally people around their world view, Russian authorities have tried to magnify the country\u2019s past victories while glossing over the more sordid chapters of its history. They have rewritten textbooks, funded sprawling historical exhibitions and suppressed \u2014 sometimes harshly \u2014 voices that contradict their narrative. Russian officials have also regularly bristled at Ukraine and other European countries for pulling down Soviet monuments, widely seen there as an unwanted legacy of past oppression, and even put scores of European officials on a wanted list over that in a move that made headlines this month. \u201cIn the hands of the authorities,\u201d says Oleg Orlov, co-founder of Memorial, Russia\u2019s oldest and most prominent rights group, \u201chistory has become a hammer \u2014 or even an axe.\u201d THE GLORIFYING From the early years of his quarter-century rule, Putin has repeatedly contended that studying their history should make Russians proud. Even controversial figures, such as Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, contributed to Russia\u2019s greatness, Putin argues. (Russian media have counted over 100 monuments to Stalin in Russia, most of which were installed during Putin\u2019s rule.)The Russian president has said that there should be one \u201cfundamental state narrative\u201d instead of different textbooks that contradict each other. And he has called for a \u201cuniversal\u201d history textbook that would convey that narrative. But that idea, criticized heavily by historians, didn\u2019t gain much traction for quite a while \u2014 until Russia invaded Ukraine.

Grade 11. A basic level\", in Tallinn, Estonia, Tuesday, Feb. 13, 2024.(AP Photo)Last year, the government rolled out a series of four new \u201cuniversal\u201d history textbooks for 10th- and 11th-graders. One featured a chapter on Moscow\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine, blamed the West for the Cold War and described the collapse of the Soviet Union as \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\u201d Some historians derided it as blatant propaganda. \u201cThe Soviet Union, and later Russia, is (depicted in the textbook as) always a besieged fortress, which constantly lives surrounded by enemies. These hostile circles are trying to weaken Russia in every conceivable way and seize its resources,\u201d says historian Nikita Sokolov. The Kremlin-friendly vision of Russian history is also dominating a chain of sprawling, state-funded \u201chistory parks\u201d \u2013 venues that host history-themed exhibitions in 24 cities across the country.                    MORE FROM RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR                For many Ukrainians, life is split in two: Before and after the war. This is one family\u2019s storyUkraine\u2019s Zelenskyy says foreign aid delays are making life \u2018very difficult\u2019 on the front linePutin is trying to take advantage of a stalemate in Ukraine but the war is also draining for RussiaThose venues were opened after a series of historical exhibitions in the early 2010s drew hundreds of thousands of Russians and received praise from Putin. Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov), a Russian Orthodox bishop reported to be Putin\u2019s personal confessor, was the driving force behind them. Packed with animations, touch-screen displays and other flashy elements, those widely popular expositions were criticized by historians for inaccurate claims and deliberate glorification of Russian rulers and their conquests. One exhibition described Ivan the Terrible, a 16th-century Russian czar known for his violent purges of Russian nobility, as a victim of \u201can information war.\u201d Another was widely advertised with a quote falsely attributed to Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of the German Empire in the 19th century, that was removed swiftly after sparking outcry: \u201cIt is impossible to defeat the Russians. We have seen this ourselves over hundreds of years. But Russians can be instilled with false values, and then they will defeat themselves.\u201d Moscow students dressed in the fashion of the middle of the last century and Soviet style uniform perform \u201cVictory Waltz\u201d as a part of Victory Day celebration in front of the historical main gates of VDNKh, The Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, with the red star in the background in Moscow, Russia, Saturday, May 6, 2023. (AP Photo, File)Central to this narrative of an invincible Russia is the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Marked on May 9 \u2014 Germany officially capitulated after midnight Moscow time on May 9, 1945 \u2014 the Soviet victory has become integral to Russian identity. The Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people in the war, pushing German forces from Stalingrad, deep inside Russia, all the way to Berlin. The suffering and valor that went into the German defeat have been touchstones ever since, and under Putin Victory Day has become the country\u2019s primary secular holiday.For the authorities, \u201cRussia\u2019s history is a road from one victory to the next,\u201d sums up Orlov, whose group won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022. \u201cAnd more beautiful victories lie ahead. And (the Kremlin says that) we must be proud of our history; history is a means of instilling patriotism. Of course in their view, patriotism is appreciation of the leadership \u2013 be it the leadership of the czarist Russia, the leadership of the Soviet Russia or the current leadership.\u201dTHE SILENCINGAs celebrations of Victory Day over the years grew more imperious, Putin\u2019s government grew less tolerant of any questioning or criticism of the Soviet Union\u2019s actions in that war \u2014 or generally. In 2014, Russian cable networks dropped Dozhd, the county\u2019s sole independent TV channel, after it hosted a history program on the 1941-44 Siege of Leningrad and asked viewers to vote on whether Soviet authorities should have surrendered Leningrad to save lives. Famine in the city, now called St. Petersburg, killed more than 500,000 people during the siege. The question caused an uproar, with officials accusing the channel of crossing moral and ethical lines. People attend the Immortal Regiment march through the main street toward Red Square marking the 77th anniversary of the end of World War II, in Moscow, Russia, Monday, May 9, 2022. (AP Photo/Denis Tyrin, File)That same year, the Russian government adopted a law that made \u201crehabilitating Nazism\u201d \u2013 or \u201cspreading knowingly false information about the actions of the USSR during World War II\u201d \u2013 a criminal offense. The first conviction on those charges was reported in 2016. A man was fined 200,000 rubles (about $3,000 at the time) for a social media post saying that \u201cthe Communists and Germany attacked Poland together, unleashing World War II.\u201d In the years that followed, the number of convictions on the charge only grew.Research and public debate about mass repressions by Stalin also have faced significant resistance in recent years. Historians and rights advocates cite the inevitable parallels to the current crackdown against dissent that has already landed hundreds of people behind bars. Two historians involved in researching Stalin\u2019s mass executions in northwestern Russia were jailed in recent years \u2013 prosecutions on unrelated charges many link to their work. Memorial, Russia\u2019s oldest and most prominent human rights group that drew international acclaim for its studies of political repression in the Soviet Union, has been shut down. It continues to work, but its activities in Russia have been significantly curtailed. And a queue of people waiting for their turn to read out the names of victims of Soviet repressions no longer snakes through central Moscow streets in late October. The tradition to read them aloud once a year in front of a monument to victims of Soviet repressions \u2014 called \u201cReturning the Names\u201d \u2014 was started in 2007 and once attracted thousands of people. In 2020, Moscow authorities stopped authorizing it, citing COVID-19.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File)The authorities are threatened by efforts to preserve historical memory, and it has gotten worse since the war in Ukraine began, says Natalya Baryshnikova, producer of last year\u2019s \u201cReturning the Names,\u201d which in 2023 went ahead in dozens of cities abroad and online.\u201cWe see this very clearly\u201d since the Ukraine war began, says Baryshnikova. \u201cAny grassroots civil movement or statement about the memory of Soviet terror is inconvenient.\u201dTHE JUSTIFYINGAccording to prominent history teacher Tamara Eidelman, the historical narrative the Kremlin is trying to impose on society contains several main elements: the primacy of the state, the affairs of which are always more important than individual lives; the cult of self-sacrifice and readiness to give up one\u2019s life for a greater cause; and the cult of war. \u201cOf course, (the latter) is never explicitly spelled out,\u201d Eidelman says. Instead, the narrative is: \u201c`We have always strived for peace \u2026 We have always been attacked and merely fought back.\u2019\u201dThat laid the perfect ideological groundwork for the invasion of Ukraine, she says, and points out how the \u201cNever again!\u201d sentiment about World War II for some in Russia in recent years became \u201cWe can do it again\u201d \u2014 a popular slogan after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 as the Kremlin adopted increasingly aggressive rhetoric toward the West.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko, File)Indeed, in the years before the Ukraine war, Putin cited history increasingly often. In 2020, during a reform that reset the limits on his presidential terms, a reference to history was even added to the country\u2019s constitution \u2014 a new clause that stipulated Russia is \u201cunited by a thousand-year history\u201d and \u201cenforces protection of the historical truth.\u201dIn 2020-21, Putin published two lengthy articles on history \u2014 one criticizing the West for actions leading up to World War II, another arguing that Ukrainians and Russians have always been one people. In an address to the nation days before sending troops into Ukraine, he once again invoked history, claiming Ukraine as a state was created artificially by Soviet leaders. History \u201chas been used to legitimize the regime essentially since the beginning of Putin\u2019s rule,\u201d Ivan Kurilla, a historian at Wellesley College, said in a recent article. And with the war in Ukraine, it \u201cfinally took a central place in the state ideology next to geopolitical talk about sovereignty, the \u2018decline of the West\u2019 and the protection of traditional values.\u201dDASHA LITVINOVA                Litvinova is an Associated Press correspondent covering Russia, Belarus, Central Asia and the Caucasus.

Russians seem to like to kill the defenseless and helpless. They can\u2019t do it at the front \u2014 there they have been repelled \u2014 so in the middle of the night, they launch missiles at maternity hospitals, high-rise buildings, train stations, metro stations, schools, libraries.The worst thing during the attacks is the endless messages we send one another. The stupidest of the stupid is the question \u201cHow are you?\u201d That question flies above Kyiv, Odesa, Kherson, Dnipro, gathering replies. \u201cIt fell close.\u201d \u201cI see a fire.\u201d \u201cWe are fine but it is burning somewhere here.\u201d \u201cThe house across from us is no more.\u201d \u201cThe smell of death, my Anya said it smells like death.\u201d Yet there is no alternative. It is a question that, for all its ridiculousness, cannot be left unanswered. Silence means misfortune and death.We, the people of a decade of war, are used to those. The world is talking of a second anniversary. Wrong: The war has not been two years but 10, from when Russian forces annexed Crimea and invaded the Donbas. Calling it an anniversary isn\u2019t quite right, either. In Ukrainian, the period of time equivalent to a year is defined by two words: \u201crichnytsia\u201d (anniversary) and \u201crokovyny\u201d (commemoration). \u201cRokovyny\u201d often refers to memorial services, while \u201crichnytsia\u201d pertains more to celebrating life. So much sorrow has settled in our memory and calendars that everything is a memorial now.Yet despite all the \u201crokovyny\u201d in Ukraine across the centuries \u2014 the Baturyn massacre in the 18th century and the Valuev and Ems decrees in the 19th century, the executions in Bykivnia and Sandarmokh and the Holodomor under Soviet rule, the murder of the Heavenly Hundred in 2014 and the recent devastation of Bucha, Bakhmut and the Kakhovka dam \u2014 we\u2019re still here. We are still fighting for \u201crichnytsias,\u201d for anniversaries and jubilees of our victory.In these most recent years of war, a lot has changed. In Mariupol, there was a community center called Halabuda \u2014 a place where Japanese and computer literacy were taught, where book launches and concerts were held, where people learned to be businessmen and proactive citizens, where they painted, sang and developed projects for an environmentally friendly city. After a brutal monthslong siege led to the Russian capture of the city in the spring of 2022, Halabuda had to relocate. Today in Cherkasy, a city in central Ukraine, it\u2019s where people repair drones.There\u2019s so much more left unrealized. More destinies that played out as heroic in war, but whose bearers can no longer do the things they may have been fated to: write books, open restaurants or discover a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Their smiles now exist only in photographs.Among the things that have changed, perhaps, is the desire to tell the world what the Russians have done and are doing to Ukrainians, in the past and today. It used to be so vivid, so resonant, creating a second self for me \u2014 a self with stories of slain friends and photos of mass burials, along with a firm conviction that every death, every sorrow must be told, documented and avenged.That feeling is gone. There are still the stories, photos and convictions. But I don\u2019t want to tell the world about it anymore. The world is literate. It has access to the internet, to the news; it can see everything itself. I am grateful to the thousands, perhaps millions of people to whom we don\u2019t have to explain or show anything anymore. They simply stood by us in Lithuania and Australia, Britain and Norway, the United States and Morocco, Japan and Estonia. I was lucky enough to know some of them by name. I was lucky enough to meet them \u2014 fearless and kind people \u2014 in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv and even in places where the front line is a kilometer away.On the other hand, nothing has changed, not really. We have the same sense of clarity that we had in 2014. The same faith, the same love, the same rage. Do I want to go back to my prewar self, the one I was in 2013? No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to find myself back among the lies about \u201cone people\u201d from which genocide, war and murder will sprout again. I do not want to be back in the time when Russia\u2019s attack was inevitable. I want us to win and there to be no war.I think a lot about how in the first months of 2022, we might not have survived. It was my greatest fear. But the experience of those unnoticed war years, when Ukrainians fought Russian-backed forces in the country\u2019s east, kicked in. It provided me with the strength, people and ability to be resilient, to withstand. I fled Donetsk in 2014. I decided I wouldn\u2019t run anymore in 2022. I have never felt better. I have never been and will never be better than in those first months of the full-scale onslaught on Kyiv. In the words of the poet Serhiy Zhadan: \u201cTo be a sunflower in the fields of Donbas is to know how to live and what to die for.\u201d I was a sunflower on the streets of Kyiv.This year brought a new fear. I thought about the weapons we so desperately lack today. I started to wonder whether they are being given to us slowly not in an attempt to forestall Russia\u2019s total defeat, as some have thought, but simply because they do not exist. \u201cAnd what if they really don\u2019t have it?\u201d I asked my friend who is a warrior. \u201cThen it\u2019s the same as now,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe stand. We fight. We endure.\u201d My warrior friend knows how to calm me down. Before the war, he was an accountant. Now he is an artilleryman. And a bit of a philosopher.We all try to stand up for ourselves. It means different things to different people. For some, it\u2019s holding the front line. It\u2019s weaving kilometers-long camouflage nets, tirelessly evacuating the wounded, donating every bit of money to the military. For others, it\u2019s teaching children, baking bread, taking care of abandoned animals, telling jokes. Whatever we do, we are all standing up for ourselves right now, when we have a chance to escape from the occupier\u2019s boot forever. To be free, to be alive. Now, when our chance to exist as a political nation, as a community, as a state, is equal to victory in war.We are not just fighting for ourselves. We are fighting for a world in which it is safe to live. Is it appropriate at this point to ask for more weapons? We desperately need them. We need more weapons to prevent children\u2019s literature from becoming literature for the dead; to avoid having graveyards filled with dead poets, dead villagers, dead engineers; to prevent cemeteries from replacing cities or Russian missiles from targeting our hospitals, schools and homes. We need support because despite emerging from 10 years of war stronger, better and wiser, we are only human.Olena Stiazhkina is a historian and the author of \u201cCecil the Lion Had to Die,\u201d among other books.

However, it is often overlooked that 2024 also signifies a decade of conflict and unrest in the country.Immense humanitarian needs persist as the war continues to displace civilians and reduce access to education, economic opportunities, health care, food security, and gender equality.Over 10,000 civilians have been killed since 24 February 2022.Meanwhile, financial support for Ukraine's humanitarian response plans is diminishing, while severe restrictions on humanitarian access hinder the ability of aid workers to deliver life-saving assistance to Ukrainians residing outside the areas under the control of the government of Ukraine.Learn more about what Ukrainian civilians are facing after a decade of conflict.

Fighting over the following eight years resulted in the death of over 3,000 people, the displacement of more than 850,000 others and left almost 3 million Ukrainians in need of humanitarian assistance.An IRC client explains, \u201cPeople have not been able to return home for 10 years, like me and my child. We have been wandering around strange corners for 10 years now, changing schools, moving.\u201dOn 24 February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine. The two-year mark of the invasion is a powerful reminder that the impact of this war transcends the immediate events of 2022, encompassing a prolonged period of hardship for those affected.\u00a0Russian attacks continue to leave millions without access to heat, electricity, water, or\u00a0sanitation for extended periods of time. The IRC operates in the most challenging regions of Ukraine, providing assistance to those in need.\u00a0A Ukrainian mother and daughter meet at the Medyka border crossing in Poland in early March 2022.Photo: Francesco Pistilli for IRCHow is the war in Ukraine affecting civilians?Ukrainian civilians are disproportionately shouldering the devastating consequences of the war. Two years of full-scale invasion have displaced almost 10 million Ukrainians and left approximately one-third\u00a0of the population in need of humanitarian support inside the country. Many families have been displaced several times over.For the majority of Ukrainians, ordinary life remains out of reach. Schools, hospitals, and homes have been devastated by missile strikes. Access to essential services is diminished, and many Ukrainians have endured harsh winter months with limited resources.Ukraine\u2019s humanitarian needs remain immenseSome 14.6 million Ukrainians will need humanitarian assistance in 2024, including the 3.7 million people who are internally displaced.About one third of the population - including 1.5 million children - are grappling with mental health issues, suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The ravages of war have shattered support networks, leaving a staggering impact.\u00a0According to a survey conducted by the IRC, an astonishing 74% of clients reported being forcibly separated from a loved one. Moreover, 82% said that they experienced feelings of anxiety, stress, or sadness over the past few months. These distressing figures highlight the profound emotional toll war inflicts on individuals and the urgent need for compassionate intervention.The war\u2019s economic impact is also driving needs. The lack of financial resources to buy firewood, solid fuel, and warm clothes increases vulnerability. Many individuals are finding it increasingly difficult to provide enough food for their families. One out of every five Ukrainian households experienced food insecurity in 2023.The protracted nature of the conflict in Ukraine has made its impacts especially overwhelming, as many Ukrainians report feeling drained by ten years of conflict, with a sense that there is no end in sight.Meet Ukrainians affected by the war.Dr. Oleg (left) leads the IRC\u2019s mobile medical team in Kharkiv.

A 2023 report identified at least 43 facilities tasked with the \u201cpolitical re-education\u201d of Ukrainian children.In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children\u2019s Rights Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, alleging that they were responsible for the war crime of \u201cunlawful deportation of children.\u201dUkrainian refugees face barriers to servicesDespite finding safety in Europe, 6 million Ukrainian refugees still encounter obstacles in accessing crucial services and supporting their families. Only 40-60% of Ukrainian refugees are employed, often stuck in low-skilled positions that fail to match their qualifications. Meanwhile, a growing number find themselves in a vulnerable state, lacking the means to sustain themselves.They also face significant barriers to education; during the 2022-2023 academic year, almost half of Ukrainian school-aged refugees remained outside of the education system of their host countries. A multitude of factors contribute to the low enrollment rates, including administrative, linguistic, and legal obstacles. Additionally, limited awareness of available options and parental reluctance to enroll their children in host country schools, due to their intention of returning to Ukraine, further exacerbate the issue.Education is a fundamental right under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Sofiia and her mother, Olga, are refugees from Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region. They have found safety in Katowice, Poland where they regularly attend an IRC community livelihood community center where Olga receives employment support and Sofiia participates in learning activities.Photo: Tamara Kiptenko for the IRCAttacks on civilian infrastructureThroughout the 10-year conflict in Ukraine, schools have become a target of artillery strikes and have been occupied as military encampments, disrupting education for millions of children. More than 4,000 attacks on education facilities and over 1,300 attacks on health care facilities have been recorded since February 2022. International humanitarian law (IHL) forbids intentional attacks on civilians.\u00a0Deliberately targeting civilians or critical civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, could be deemed a war crime.Over 1.5 million homes have been destroyed and more than 27,000 civilian casualties have been recorded, including more than 10,000 deaths. The number of civilian casualties is believed to be considerably greater than reported due to the inability to include areas that are inaccessible due to ongoing hostilities.Despite repeated calls from the international community to respect IHL and to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure, everyday Ukrainians continue to suffer from this war.Andriy stands in the ruins of a school in Vasylenkove, Ukraine. The village\u2019s hospital was also destroyed by the war.Photo: Oleksandr Rupeta for the IRCHow is the war affecting Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure and economy?The war has significantly damaged Ukraine\u2019s housing, transport, energy, and commerce and industry sectors.\u00a0According to the World Bank, Ukraine witnessed a 10% decline in GDP in 2014, coinciding with the onset of the conflict. Subsequently, with Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, the GDP contracted by almost one-third.Amid positive signs of economic improvement, critical sectors like agriculture continue to reel from the effects of the ongoing conflict. An area the size of Romania is now riddled with landmines and the Nova Kakhkova dam explosion has left 600,000 hectares of arable land without irrigation.\u00a0Reconstruction and recovery costs are expected to exceed $410 billion.Ukrainians are struggling to make ends meetWith an unemployment rate of 17% and a substantial rise in poverty rates, a growing number of individuals find themselves in a perpetual battle to meet essential needs such as food, clothing, and medicine.An IRC survey of Ukrainian clients found that 70% of respondents reported losing a job or needing to change their career path as a result of the conflict, including 45% who had to accept another job with a lower wage or below their qualifications.What is the Black Sea Grain Initiative?Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative\u00a0-\u00a0a mechanism that allowed for the continued export of Ukrainian grain - is impacting both Ukraine\u2019s agriculture sector and international food securitySeveral grain-receiving countries across the Middle East and Africa have been experiencing hunger crises due to the compounded effects of conflict and climate change. The war in Ukraine made these hunger crises worse, putting more than 40 million lives in East Africa at risk.

The IRC has also provided direct cash assistance to more than 130,000 people in Ukraine.Our emergency programmes are also active on the ground across Europe and in the US. We respond to people\u2019s immediate and long-term needs, with activities targeting refugees from Ukraine in Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia, and Bulgaria, as well as in Germany, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\u00a0Learn more about the IRC\u2019s response to the crisis in Ukraine.Denis and her mother, Kateryna, stand in front of empty gas cylinders that the IRC distributed to residents of Kherson, along with cash assistance.

However, the funding for Ukraine's humanitarian response witnessed a decline from meeting 87% of the requirements in 2022 to 61.8% in 2023.Nearly two years since the Russian invasion, and a decade into conflict, it is critical to continue supporting people affected by the war, both those within Ukraine and those who have fled to neighboring countries.Donate today to support the IRC\u2019s delivery of critical humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and in more than 50 countries worldwide.Explore related topics:IRC in UkraineUkraine refugeesWar in UkraineCrisis WatchWho we areWhere we workWhat we doHow to HelpLatestContact UsGlossary of migration termsEthics HotlineCode of ConductIRC Deutschland Annual Report 2021Our efficiency87% Program services8% Management and general5% FundraisingDonateFollow usRescue websites: US/GlobalGermanyKoreaSwedenUKPrivacy policyTerms and conditionsCopyright \u00a9 International Rescue Committee, 2024.\u00d7Search   ", "metadata": {"source": "International Rescue Committee", "time": "1708511587000"}}, {"page_content": "Ukraine war: Hardened Colombian fighters answer Zelenskyy's call to join depleted ranks | AP NewsMenuMenuWorldU.S.Election 2024PoliticsSportsEntertainmentBusinessScienceFact CheckOdditiesNewslettersVideoHealthPhotography ClimateSpotlightTechLifestyleReligionPress Releases...WorldIsrael-Hamas War    Russia-Ukraine War    Latin America    Europe    Africa    Middle East    Asia Pacific    U.S. News    Australia    China    U.S.Election 2024PoliticsJoe Biden    Election 2024    Congress    SportsAP Top 25 College Football Poll    NFL    MLB    NHL    NBA    WNBA    Soccer    Tennis    Golf    EntertainmentMovie reviews    Book reviews    Celebrity    Television    Music    BusinessInflation    Financial Markets    Business Highlights    Financial wellness    ScienceFact CheckOdditiesNewslettersVideoHealthPhotography ClimateSpotlightTechArtificial Intelligence    Social Media    LifestyleReligionPress Releases                  Search Query              Submit Search            Show Search        WorldIsrael-Hamas War    Russia-Ukraine War    Latin America    Europe    Africa    Middle East    Asia Pacific    U.S. News    Australia    China    U.S.Election 2024PoliticsJoe Biden    Election 2024    Congress    SportsAP Top 25 College Football Poll    NFL    MLB    NHL    NBA    WNBA    Soccer    Tennis    Golf    EntertainmentMovie reviews    Book reviews    Celebrity    Television    Music    BusinessInflation    Financial Markets    Business Highlights    Financial wellness    ScienceFact CheckOdditiesNewslettersVideoHealthPhotography ClimateSpotlightTechArtificial Intelligence    Social Media    LifestyleReligionPress ReleasesThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

At the military hospital normally treating wounded Ukrainian soldiers, a group of about 50 Colombian fighters spend most of their time staring at their phone screens \u2014 calling home, browsing the internet and listening to music in between meals and medical procedures, most for light injuries.As the two-year mark in the war approaches, Ukraine\u2019s forces are in a stalemate with Russia\u2019s. Ukraine is now expanding its system allowing people from around the world to join the army, said Oleksandr Shahuri, an officer of the Department of Coordination of Foreigners in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.Wounded Colombian veterans, who joined the Ukrainian armed forces to help fight Russia, look at their phones in a hospital in Ukraine, Wednesday, Dec. 20, 2023.

Now, in keeping with the secrecy surrounding any military numbers, authorities will not say how many are on the battlefield but they do say fighters\u2019 profile has changed.The first waves of volunteers came mostly from post-Soviet or English-speaking countries.

Corporals in Colombia get a basic salary of around $400 a month, while experienced drill sergeants can earn up to $900. Colombia\u2019s monthly minimum wage is currently $330.In Ukraine any member of the armed forces, regardless of citizenship, is entitled to a monthly salary of up to $3,300, depending on their rank and type of service. They are also entitled to up to $28,660 if they are injured, depending on the severity of the wounds. If they are killed in action, their families are due $400,000 compensation.This 2023 photo provided by a 32-year-old professional soldier from Medell\u00edn, Colombia who goes by the call sign Checho shows him in his combat gear in Donbas, eastern Ukraine.

After hosting a meeting of 25 European leaders in Paris on February 26, Macron said that there was \u201cno consensus\u201d on committing ground troops to the conflict in Ukraine but added: \u201cNothing should be excluded. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war.\u201d Until now, Nato has confined itself to training Ukrainian military forces and supplying them with defensive weapons. Member states fear that directly confronting Russian forces in Ukraine would risk a massive escalation. And Vladimir Putin and his senior ministers have regularly issued threats that Russia could resort to using its nuclear arsenal in the case of a larger conflict.At present, Nato is also conducting its largest military exercise since the cold war. Steadfast Defender runs from January until May and involves all 31 member states. Aimed at enhancing the alliance\u2019s collective defence capabilities and readiness, it is the largest exercise since Reforger in 1988, which involved 125,000 troops from the US, Germany, Canada, France and Denmark.General Christopher Cavoli, Nato\u2019s supreme allied commander for Europe, said: \u201cSteadfast Defender 2024 will be a clear demonstration of our unity, strength and determination to protect each other, our values and the rules-based international order.\u201dImportantly, one aspect of the exercises is the involvement of US and Canadian forces, which is designed to demonstrate the speed and size of Nato\u2019s reinforcement capabilities. It acts both as a reassurance to European Nato member states and as a demonstration to potential enemies of the ability Nato has to put large forces into the field. Exercises are part of the communication of deterrence.The exercise is meant to simulate an, \u201cemerging conflict scenario with a near-peer adversary\u201d. This is a thinly disguised reference to Russia, which shows that Nato is beginning to take the threat of direct conflict with that country seriously.French marines conduct a training exercise in  Harstad, Norway as part of Steadfast Defender 2024.Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Danielle Serocki/APFootage/Alamy Stock PhotoDuring the cold war, Nato undertook regular large-scale exercises. For example, Exercise Lionheart, led by the UK in 1984, involved nearly 58,000 British soldiers and airmen of a total force of 131,565, including troops from the US, the Netherlands and what was then West Germany.Since the dissolution of the Soviet bloc, Nato has searched for a new identity. Its focus shifted in the 1990s from protecting common territory to protecting members\u2019 common interests, as it did by intervening in the wars in Bosnia in 1995 and Kosovo in 1999, when it officially approved this new strategic concept.Need for unityA demonstration of Nato unity and military capacity is important, coming after two years of disunity over how to respond to the war in Ukraine and amid wrangling over supplies of arms by Ukraine\u2019s western allies. It has become more significant following recent remarks by former president Donald Trump that Nato members who did not meet the spending guidelines would no longer be protected by the US.\u2018I would not protect you\u2019: Donald Trump threatens Nato members over defence spending.Members are supposed to spend at least 2% of their annual GDP on defence \u2013 but it\u2019s more complicated than that. Some nations\u2019 defence spending is wholly allocated to Nato. Others, meanwhile, might set their defence spending at less than 2%, but their spending per head is greater than that of those who meet the Nato guideline. For example, Luxembourg falls short of the 2%, spending only 0.72%. But in per head terms it spends US$921 (\u00a3726), which is more than Poland (3.9%) or France (1.9%). The US may spend 3.5% GDP on defence, but not all of that is allocated to Nato. Much of the US\u2019s strength is deployed in the Pacific and on its home territories. So it\u2019s misleading to judge the value of Nato membership in these terms. They key clause in the Nato treaty is article 5, which governs collective security and compels members to respond if a fellow member is attacked by a hostile third party. The US is the only Nato member state to have invoked article 5, following the 9/11 attacks. It received assistance from other Nato members in Afghanistan and more widely in the \u201cwar on terror\u201d.Is Nato battle ready?A significant problem Nato faces however, is not in deploying the troops it has, but in supplying them. As has been demonstrated by the efforts to provide equipment and ammunition to Ukraine, Nato has neither the stockpiles nor the manufacturing capacity to supply a lengthy modern war. This is because Nato has long planned on what\u2019s known as a \u201ccome as you are\u201d war, which means it has the capacity to fight for only as long as the equipment and supplies last. For this reason, Nato\u2019s strategy has always been, in the event of a conflict, to bring it to a conclusion as quickly as possible. Admiral Rob Bauer of the Royal Netherlands Navy, Nato\u2019s most senior military commander and military adviser to its North Atlantic Council, spoke at the Warsaw Security Forum in October 2023. He said: \u201cWe need large volumes. The just-in-time, just-enough economy we built together in 30 years in our liberal economies is fine for a lot of things \u2013 but not the armed forces when there is a war ongoing.\u201dA number of European countries have already distanced themselves from Macron\u2019s remarks, including Poland, the Czech republic and Sweden, whose Nato membership has finally been approved by Hungary and which is set to become the alliance\u2019s 32nd member.But Russia has seized on Macron\u2019s remarks, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov telling reporters that even discussing the idea of western troops being sent to fight in Ukraine represents a \u201cvery important new element\u201d. He added: \u201cIn that case, we would need to talk not about the probability, but about the inevitability (of a direct conflict).\u201dNATOUS foreign policyVladimir PutinEmmanuel MacronUkraine invasion 2022Give me perspectiveWant to write?

To reverse Moscow\u2019s progress, the West will need to invest more in supporting Kyiv.

Since that time, the conflict has drifted towards the more negative end of expectations. Over the past year, Ukraine was unable to reverse many of Russia\u2019s territorial gains, and by the winter Moscow had regained the strategic initiative.At the end of 2022, Russia was in a worse predicament than Ukraine is now, but after hitting this low it found ways to fix its main problems. It began to innovate in terms of its military tactics in order to use its forces more effectively, used innovative recruitment tactics to fill its ranks, and transitioned towards a war economy to increase production of much-needed equipment.In contrast, the West failed to enact the policies necessary to ease Ukraine\u2019s materiel shortages. Over 2023, there was no concerted defence-industrial effort to resupply Ukraine with armoured fighting vehicles of various kinds. Even the production of ammunition is a long way behind schedule, particularly in Europe: of the 2.3 million shells used by Ukraine in 2023, only 300,000 were European. Joint European procurement initiatives on ammunition only became a reality in late 2023, and similar initiatives for military equipment will get going by 2024 at the earliest.The time this takes to materialise exacerbates Ukraine\u2019s dependency on American support, with the US presidential election in November likely to determine the country\u2019s fate. While current budgetary battles in the United States and partisan fights over military assistance have kicked in earlier than expected, Europeans nevertheless failed to use the last 12 months to prepare for this turn of events. The European Union\u2019s much-vaunted strategic autonomy goal is a mirage.As I predicted a year ago, there is no ceasefire, no negotiation, and no stalemate. Time and again, Vladimir Putin has made clear his aim is not to conquer just 20 per cent of Ukraine. In his mind, Russia and Ukraine are one, and the existence of an independent Ukrainian nation is an anti-Russian plot cooked up through foreign interference. His speech to the Russian defence ministry last month reconfirmed this ambition. He wants to annex the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine and would likely be content to turn the remainder into an occupied puppet state, little different to today\u2019s Belarus.Furthermore, Putin\u2019s political aim is to re-establish Russia as a new great power, reshaping the political order of Europe. Re-establishing the \u201cunity\u201d of Russia-Ukraine-Belarus is the precondition for this resurrection. A true ceasefire, or the abandonment of further attempts to conquer Ukraine, would for Putin mean not only the abandonment of his aspirations in that country, but his entire political vision for the future international order. He has invested immense resources in this gamble and will not easily reconsider, if not forced to do so. For these reasons, only binary outcomes are possible: either Russia wins or Ukraine wins.2024 will be the most challenging time for Ukraine since the first two months of the full-scale invasionGiven Western hesitation to ramp up arms production, and the lack of planning for the period after the counter-offensive, 2024 will be the most challenging time for Ukraine since the first two months of the full-scale invasion. By mid-2023, Kyiv had more or less given up relying on the West to resupply it with what it needed to sustain the war: drones, electronic warfare systems, and armoured combat vehicles such as tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The Ukrainian government looked at producing these locally and initiated an ambitious programme not only to resurrect Ukraine\u2019s pre-war arms industry, but even to surpass it with the assistance of Western companies. This has met with some success, but these vehicles will not be ready until next year, and will be available in larger quantities only by 2026. On top of this, Ukraine will remain dependent on the West for aircraft, aircraft armaments, and complex air-defence missiles because the complexity of these systems does not allow domestic production. Ukraine will also remain dependent on the supply of artillery munitions from abroad because of the sheer quantity used in the war.To this backdrop, three main scenarios present themselves.The positive scenarioIn the most positive scenario for Ukraine, Donald Trump finds himself barred from running for the presidency and Nikki Haley becomes the Republican nominee. She quickly moves to criticise the administration\u2019s weakness and indecision, which Joe Biden responds to by sending greater aid to Ukraine. The domestic mood turns around, and the US begins to provide Ukraine with more generous assistance, particularly more modern F-16C/D fighters, which have proper stand-off munitions and ATACMS missiles. With these, Ukraine is able to push Russian air forces further back from the front, decreasing their effectiveness.While Ukraine blunts Russian offensives and inflicts significant losses in manpower and equipment, it simultaneously manages to improve its training activities behind the front. It increases the cohesion of its units, forms \u201cnew force\u201d brigades, and tests new prototypes of electronic warfare equipment and drone defence weapons.The EU officially lists the defence industry as a sustainable industry, which eases access to research and development funds, credits, and insurance. This enables enhanced production of ammunition, vehicle spare parts, and the electronics that feed into Ukrainian drone manufacturing. And although the EU\u2019s move is much too late to make a difference this year, its effect will be felt in the years after. As such, by the end of 2024, Ukraine has put in place the preconditions needed to regain the initiative and liberate more territories in 2025, when more armoured combat vehicles roll off domestic and Western assembly lines and ammunition production has caught up with demand. In this regard, who wins the US presidential election has little bearing on events on the ground.The intermediate scenarioIn the intermediate scenario, the Biden administration muddles though 2024 in a messy election campaign. Republicans in Congress behave transactionally, trading Ukraine assistance packages for concessions on domestic pet projects such as the wall along the United States\u2019 southern border. The US carries on drip-feeding assistance to Ukraine.Meanwhile, Europeans continue to deliver only around a third of their ammunition and spare parts pledges, which helps the US keep Ukraine afloat \u2013 but only in a defensive posture. Ukraine manages to hold its lines on the battlefield. In Donbas, it will have to cede some terrain under Russian pressure. But it will maintain the integrity of its defensive lines and the formations fighting there. Ukraine\u2019s lack of armoured vehicles becomes particularly noticeable in the second half of 2024, once Europeans have expended their delivery of cold war legacy vehicles they had held in storage. Western-designed vehicles continue to suffer from shortages of spare parts, while Warsaw Pact legacy vehicles suffer from ammunition shortages.To cope with the insufficient materiel and the lack of trained officers, Ukraine disbands some newly formed brigades to achieve better manning levels of the remaining formations. It also continues to develop and experiment with new domestically produced equipment and refine its defensive tactics and unit cohesion during the year. However, because it needs to sacrifice soldiers to conserve precious and irreplaceable equipment, manning will become an increasing challenge by the end of 2024. Old and used European F-16A/B aircraft continue the role played by the Soviet fighters in the Ukrainian air force: they keep Russian planes away from civilian centres but struggle to contain them close to the front. In a nutshell, Ukraine remains on the defensive and survives 2024, with the result of the US presidential election set to decide the course of the war in 2025.The negative scenarioIn the most negative scenario for Ukraine, Trump becomes the presidential nominee, and increasingly anti-Ukrainian rhetoric dominates US discourse. In Congress, Republicans want to see Biden fail under any circumstances and refuse to accept horse-trades to keep the supply lines to Ukraine open. Europeans still send arms, but they lack the production capabilities and reserve stock needed to make up for the US. They fail to agree on long-term funding in the European Peace Facility, or to conclude large, long-term contracts for vehicles or ammunition, meaning the production capability of the European defence industry barely changes. At the same time, European defence-industrial cooperation with Ukraine faces difficulties.Ukrainian forces thus find themselves increasingly short of the shells and missiles they need just to maintain even defensive action. The Russian armed forces exploit this situation to increase the pressure on Ukrainian lines. Russian breakthroughs can only be contained by Ukrainian forces retreating. This pressure prevents Ukraine from properly rotating its forces in the front, leaving it unable to pull brigades from line duty to train and reconstitute them. By the end of 2024, most Ukrainian brigades are tired and exhausted.In the absence of US deliveries, Ukraine runs critically short of surface-to-air missiles and air-to-air missiles for its fighter force. Russia exploits this by quickening the pace of strategic bombing against Ukrainian cities. Shahed drones probe local air defences, with conventional fighters following up by joining cruise missile attacks. These bombing campaigns impede Ukraine\u2019s plans to resurrect its defence industry and replace Western combat systems with domestically produced systems. The increasingly grim outlook convinces many Ukrainians to flee. By the end of 2024, 10 million Ukrainians have fled to the EU, with numbers rising. The cost to Europeans of hosting refugees far outweighs the cost of assisting Kyiv militarily.At the end of the year, Trump defeats Biden. Panic grips Europe, and many European capitals halt deliveries to Ukraine altogether, funnelling military supplies into their own armed forces in expectation of a US withdrawal from Europe and imminent Russian attacks on their own countries. The war in Ukraine is seen as lost by most in the West, although Ukraine itself keeps fighting against the odds.Course correctionBy the end of 2022, the Russian army had gone through its phase of weakness. Short of manpower, it had been driven off significant portions of terrain by a more agile, better motivated Ukrainian army. At that time the mood was optimistic, and a Russian defeat seemed probable. But these trends have now reversed.The West still has agency in this war; it can still turn things around. For Europeans in particular, this means putting their money where their mouth is. The acquisition of ammunition, missiles, combat vehicles, and spare parts is severely behind schedule \u2013 not that it was ambitious to begin with. Although late in the day, Europeans can still correct this course. \u00a0The European Council on Foreign Relations does not take collective positions.

For years, as Moscow\u2019s intent to challenge the West became clearer, a key question loomed: whether the country as a whole or its leader was at fault\u2014in effect, whether the world had a Russia problem or a Putin problem.Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, analysts have continued to debate the attitudes of ordinary Russians toward the war. Do a broad majority of Russians genuinely support the crimes and atrocities committed by their country\u2019s armed forces? And if not, why do they give every appearance of doing so?Two books by British historian Jade McGlynn published during 2023 provide uncomfortable answers. Russia\u2019s War gives one of those answers in its title: In direct and conscious contrast to a rash of other current book titles that lay the blame squarely on Russian President Vladimir Putin, McGlynn concludes that the Russian state, with the conscious collusion of part or most of its population, has achieved significant and widespread support at home for its war of colonial reconquest in Ukraine. Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin\u2019s Russia, Jade McGlynn, Bloomsbury Academic, 248 pp., , June 2023; Russia\u2019s War, Jade McGlynn, Polity, 264 pp., , May 2023Russia\u2019s War, Jade McGlynn, Polity, 264 pp., $54, May 2023; Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin\u2019s Russia, Jade McGlynn, Bloomsbury Academic, 248 pp., $27, June 2023The other book, Memory Makers, gives us more explanation of how this was made possible through Russia\u2019s deliberate and long-term program of hijacking history and shaping the public\u2019s memory by recreating the past in order to shape the present.Together, they paint a portrait of the alternative reality inhabited by Russians, created and nurtured by the state, and explain how it provides a permissive environment for that state\u2019s worst crimes against both its own people and its victims abroad.Russia\u2019s War will upset a lot of people. There\u2019s a substantial group among Russians abroad\u2014or at least, among those who do not wholeheartedly approve of the war\u2014who make their point that not all Russians are to blame for it by attempting to attach that blame to Putin personally.But McGlynn firmly rejects the idea that this is Putin\u2019s war alone. \u201cRussia\u2019s war on Ukraine is popular with large numbers of Russians and acceptable to an even larger number,\u201d she writes. \u201cPutin banked on the population\u2019s approval and he cashed it.\u201dMcGlynn\u2019s book is also a direct challenge to those Western journalists, academics, and Russophiles who cling to the belief that the country is a frustrated democracy, as well as the idea that left to their own devices, Russians would install a liberal government that was less inclined to repress its own subjects and wage wars of aggression abroad. That\u2019s a belief that has often been formed in conversation with urban, liberal Russians\u2014the kind who are now largely in exile or jail.But there\u2019s no reason to think that conversations in Moscow and St. Petersburg are any better a guide to Russia\u2019s population as a whole than similar conversations in New York or London were at predicting former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory or the United Kingdom\u2019s Brexit. When the idea of a country has been constructed on sampling that is as unrepresentative as this, it can be hard to come to terms with the fact that the behaviors that the world has witnessed in Ukraine are entirely within the mainstream of social norms in the further reaches of Russia.McGlynn doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that there may be Russians who disapprove of the war. But in addition to describing an instinct for self-preservation that may constrain many individuals from speaking out, she also argues that silent acquiescence is also the easier path inside their own minds.\u201cPlenty of people believe the Kremlin propaganda because it is easier and preferable to admitting or accepting that you are the bad guys,\u201d McGlynn writes. In the absence of any discernible public opposition, Russians\u2019 attitudes range from complete apathy to the frenzied enthusiasm for the war encouraged by propagandist \u201cZ-channels\u201d on Telegram, urging the military on to commit ever greater savagery in Ukraine. These channels, broadcasting to hundreds of thousands of subscribers\u2014where footage of atrocities receives a joyous reaction\u2014would not be possible in a country where backing for the onslaught on Ukraine was not widespread.Russia\u2019s state-aligned propaganda, McGlynn argues, does not seek to make everyone a warmonger. Instead, it aims to nudge people along a spectrum: It tries to render those in opposition apathetic, to make the apathetic feel attacked and side with their country whether right or wrong, and to induce quiet patriots to lend full-throated support.A further twist, McGlynn suggests, is that we should not assume that the ideal outcome for the Kremlin is widespread pro-war activism. The Kremlin distrusts any spontaneous political act even if it is in support of the regime, she reminds us. So it sets clear boundaries for what is and is not an acceptable way to show allegiance, and is content if the support shown is no more than lip service. But still, criticism of the war, where it does exist, primarily focuses on the competence with which it is being fought as opposed to whether it should be fought in the first place.Many of the state narratives around the West and Ukraine are not Putinist inventions, but instead are excuses for Russian state crimes that date back to Soviet and tsarist times. By tapping into the familiar tropes of Russia\u2019s artificial history, the Kremlin provides the basis for new and still-evolving fictions about the world outside, brought together in what McGlynn calls \u201ca time-worn ritual whereby Russian media and politicians slowly dismantle the truth and then replace it with a forgery.\u201dThat ritual is examined in detail in Memory Makers: The Politics of the Past in Putin\u2019s Russia. Appearing later than Russia\u2019s War, Memory Makers nonetheless lays the groundwork for it, exploring how Russia rewrote its history to provide justification for its present.History is explicitly defined as a battleground in Russia\u2019s national security strategy and other doctrinal documents. But as ever in Russia\u2019s perverse newspeak, goals such as the \u201cdefence of historical truth,\u201d the \u201cpreservation of memory,\u201d and \u201ccounteraction to the falsification of history\u201d translate\u00a0to the construction and defense of a fabricated version of Russian and Soviet history, accompanied by the denunciation of news and information from abroad as fake, all intended to protect and bolster Russia\u2019s alternative reality.As McGlynn explains, Russia\u2019s reworking of history builds a narrative that \u201cdistracts from government failings, promotes government policies and reinforces the Kremlin\u2019s view of current events.\u201d The two books together offer an understanding of how Russia fostered the mentality that enables the war. Memory Makers explains how it was done; Russia\u2019s War describes the effect.Across the two books, McGlynn considers the role of state propaganda in forming the attitude that she describes and the cumulative impact of more than a decade of bombardment with relentless war propaganda that dehumanizes Ukrainians and sells the idea of a hostile West. Her conclusion is that the war propaganda fell on fertile ground. Russians were eager to be guided toward the state-approved attitude that tied in closely with many of their preconceptions about the world and Russia\u2019s place in it.And this has had practical and tragic results. McGlynn helps explain why Russia\u2019s horrific casualty toll\u2014with estimates varying widely but none smaller than the hundreds of thousands\u2014has had less impact on popular support for the war than was widely and optimistically expected; and why Russia\u2019s soldiers are still fighting, despite their leadership\u2019s palpable indifference to the scale of the slaughter. Meanwhile, the dehumanization of Ukrainians that forms an integral part of the propaganda made atrocities in Ukraine not just likely, but also inevitable.In contrast with multiple books on Russia that have been produced swiftly after February 2022, both Russia\u2019s War and Memory Makers have long been in gestation. They draw on close to a decade of research, including data analysis of television, print and social media, extensive interviews, and\u2014while it was still possible\u2014firsthand investigation within Russia itself.Perhaps inevitably, that means neither book offers simple answers. Optimists among academics, journalists, and even government officials cling to the belief that if only Russians could be reached with the truth about the outside world, including the horrors committed in their name in Ukraine, they would turn against their leadership. But McGlynn\u2019s books and a mass of associated research show that far deeper and more radical societal change within Russia would be essential to reverse the effects of two decades of state propaganda.Since the end of the Soviet Union, early hopes that new generations might embrace democracy and liberalism have faded to invisibility. Instead, Russian social development is accelerating in reverse. McGlynn\u2019s research undercuts suggestions that this is being done to Russians against their will, and instead highlights attitudes ranging from complicity to enthusiasm. The result is that Russia looks almost exclusively to the past to define its vision for the future.The tragic implication is that Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine cannot be ended in or by Ukraine. Its roots lie in Russians\u2019 political and societal imagination of what their own country is and what it must be. That imagination, McGlynn shows, has been encouraged and facilitated\u2014but not created\u2014by a propaganda campaign that has lasted a generation.Jade McGlynn has assembled the evidence for a conclusion that will disturb optimists hoping for a better Russia: The campaign would not have succeeded without a willing and complicit population, and too many ordinary Russians are entirely content to back their country\u2019s most horrific actions.Books are independently selected by FP editors.

Those who escaped in the last weeks spoke of relentless devastation.Soldiers from the 71st Jaeger Brigade firing a howitzer at Russian targets in the direction of Avdiivka, Ukraine. Credit...Supported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTShare full article247By Marc SantoraPhotographs by Tyler HicksMarc Santora and Tyler Hicks traveled with civilian volunteers to villages under Russian bombardment on the outskirts of Avdiivka, and with Ukrainian military units in the area, to report this article.Published Feb. 18, 2024Updated Feb. 19, 2024Even from a few miles away, the death rattle of another Ukrainian city echoed through the mist and fog. Russian warplanes were dropping more thousand-pound bombs on Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, reducing an already battered city to rubble and ashes.Since Jan. 1, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s forces have dropped around one million pounds of aerial bombs on an area encompassing just 12 square miles, according to estimates by Ukrainian officials and British intelligence.Avdiivka fell to the Russians on Saturday, after some of the most horrific and destructive fighting of the two-year-old war. In the end, Russia\u2019s superior firepower and manpower overwhelmed Ukrainian forces over many months, even as Russia incurred a staggering number of casualties.The Ukrainians withdrew under withering bombardment, fighting intense battles across ruined streets to break out of Russian attempts to encircle them. Russian warplanes bombed the hulking coke-processing plant on Avdiivka\u2019s northern outskirts, using incendiary munitions to blow up fuel tanks at the plant, unleashing a toxic smog, according to Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the plant.\u201cAvdiivka is a constant barrage of aviation bombs,\u201d Maksym Zhorin, deputy commander of the Third Special Assault Brigade, said on Friday. \u201cIt feels like the largest number of air bombs on such a stretch of land in the entire history of humanity. These bombs completely obliterate any positions. All buildings, structures, after just one airstrike, turn into craters.\u201dImageDisplaced civilians from Avdiivka waiting for aid in the town where they were evacuated and now live. ImageIhor Fir, a former mechanic at the Avdiivka coke processing plant, taking food, water and medicine to refugees evacuated from the city because of Russia\u2019s intense bombardment. Astonishingly, more than 900 civilians had remained in the city, according to city administrators and the police \u2014 from a prewar population of 30,000 \u2014 living subterranean lives and surviving on food and supplies brought in by aid workers.In the aftermath of the Ukrainian withdrawal, their fate was unknown.\u201cI have not been able to reach anyone for the past two days,\u201d said Ihor Fir, a mechanic at the coke plant before it was destroyed, who was regularly risking his life to bring food, water and medicine to the civilians still living in Avdiivka and surrounding villages.The last messages he received were from people desperate to escape, but unable to move under the constant shelling. Any survivors in the city, he said, were likely to be stranded. \u201cThere is no way for them to get out,\u201d he said by phone on Saturday. \u201cThe road is under shelling.\u201dIn an interview last week, Mr. Fir called conditions in Avdiivka \u201cjust horrible\u201d and shared videos and photos of the devastation from his last trip into the city earlier this month. \u201cThere are ruins everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a single house left untouched.\u201dUKRAINEAvdiivkaCity boundaryApproximatearea taken byRussia sinceFeb. 13AvdiivkaHeld by Russiaon Feb. 131 mileUKRAINEAvdiivkaCity boundaryApproximatearea taken byRussia sinceFeb. 13AvdiivkaHeld by Russiaon Feb. 131 mileUKRAINEAvdiivkaCity boundaryApproximatearea taken byRussia sinceFeb. 13AvdiivkaHeld by Russiaon Feb. 131 mileNote: Territory held by Russia on Feb. 13 includes Russian claims not verified by the Institute for the Study of War.Sources: Institute for the Study of War with American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Critical Threats Project, videos, Ukrainian officialsBy Josh HolderVitalii Barabash, the head of the Avdiivka military administration, said that multistory buildings \u201ccollapse like card houses,\u201d adding, \u201cVery often people remain under the rubble and, unfortunately, we cannot reach them.\u201d He estimated earlier this month that at least 800 guided bombs, each weighing between 550 and 3,300 pounds, had been dropped this year within the city limits. His claim could not be independently confirmed, but the British intelligence agency reported that in just four weeks, Russian warplanes dropped some 600 guided bombs on Avdiivka, with as many as 50 recorded in a single day.The Russian tactics in Avdiivka were \u201ca textbook punishment campaign, which they have orchestrated in Chechnya, Syria, Ukraine and even Afghanistan,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cIt is designed,\u201d he said, \u201cto raise the societal costs of continued resistance and coerce the adversary and its population to give up.\u201d Mr. Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka as \u201can important victory,\u201d the Kremlin said on Saturday.There are no reliable statistics on the number of soldiers or civilians killed in the bombardments.Mr. Fir shared pictures of the ruins of a supermarket hit by a bomb last week as 15 people sheltered in the basement. At least 10 of them died and remained buried in the rubble, he said.\u201cA person goes to sleep and does not wake up,\u201d he said as he traveled to bring food and water to refugees in a village about three miles from Avdiivka. As the Russians advanced to the north and west, they flattened that village as well. At least half the homes where the refugees took shelter were bombed.ImageA morning airstrike from a Russian jet last June destroyed an apartment building in Avdiivka, wounding several civilians.ImageThe only remaining resident of one street in Avdiivka last June. The city already faced Russian shelling on three sides, and his apartment building was heavily damaged. Avdiivka has been on the front line of fighting for a decade, dating to Russia\u2019s first bid to cleave off a part of eastern Ukraine, in 2014. The constant skirmishes often receded into the background. Life for the 30,000 residents could be difficult, but manageable.The city was known then for the sparkling blue lakes that filled former quarries. Residents were proud and determined to stay and live an active life despite being on the front line. At the annual festival to celebrate the city\u2019s founding in 1956, the loud music would drown out distant shelling.\u201cAvd\u0456\u0456vka was a good, beautiful town,\u201d said Victoria, 52, who was one of the last civilians to escape Avdiivka this month and asked that her family name not be used because she feared for her life. \u201cWe lived. We worked. Everything was good for us.\u201dThat all ended on Feb. 24, 2022, when the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion.The Kremlin immediately set its sights on Avdiivka, shelling from a distance and skirmishing in industrial zones, but failed time and again to break through Ukrainian fortifications.After his home was destroyed last May, Mr. Fir fled with his wife. By June, there were fewer than 2,000 civilians in Avdiivka, most of them living largely underground.The hulking industrial plant with its warren of Soviet-era nuclear fallout shelters offered refuge for people as fighting intensified. But eventually civilians were evacuated and the plant became a fortress for the Ukrainian military. Civilians who remained in Avdiivka mostly sheltered in basements.Victoria refused to evacuate. \u201cMy husband was killed by a bomb on July 15, 2022,\u201d she said. He was getting water from a well when he was blown apart, she said. When her mother also died, she had only her dog and her mother\u2019s dog to keep her company.\u201cI did not want to leave because the graves of my relatives remained here,\u201d she said.ImageCivilians in another embattled Ukrainian city not too far from Avdiivka survive underground in the basements and corridors of apartment buildings to protect them from Russian shelling.ImageDisplaced civilians from Avdiivka receiving basic supplies. One woman said she had long delayed leaving \u201cbecause the graves of my relatives remained here.\u201d  Dozens of interviews over the last two years show that the reasons civilians stay behind in war zones are complicated.\u201cI just put up with it,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cI thought sooner or later, it had to end somehow. It didn\u2019t stop \u2014 it just got worse and worse.\u201dIn early October, Russia launched the first of a series of large-scale offensives aimed at broadly encircling Avdiivka.Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers were killed and wounded in repeated waves of assaults, according to Ukrainian and Western officials. Ukraine, despite suffering its own losses, held on.The Russians devised a new plan this winter, using a two-mile-long drainage tunnel to burrow under Ukrainian fortifications, infiltrate a neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city and ambush the Ukrainians.As the Russians advanced, some civilians escaped on foot to the city center, where they were met by a special police unit, known as the White Angels, to be evacuated.The Ukrainian police shared a video of an evacuation last month, with civilians describing chaos and bloodshed as Russians entered their neighborhood.\u201cWhen the Russian troops entered, it wasn\u2019t just a nightmare, it was some kind of Armageddon,\u201d an old man said. \u201cBlood, deaths, looting. Thirty-four years in the mines, and everything I did for my family, it\u2019s all destroyed.\u201dTheir accounts could not be independently verified.But dozens of horror stories were relayed by residents who managed to get out as Russian forces fought their way deeper into the city.ImageTetiana recovering at a hospital after she was injured when a bomb exploded in AvdiivkaImageViktor Hrydin, 87, who helped build the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant, long the city\u2019s economic engine, refused to leave his dwelling until a bomb on Christmas destroyed it and badly wounded the woman caring for him.Viktor Hrydin, 87, who helped build the coke plant that has long been Avdiivka\u2019s economic engine, refused to go even as his world burned around him. A neighbor, Tetiana, 52, moved in to take care of him.On Christmas, a bomb exploded at their home.\u201cI was covered in blood,\u201d Viktor said in an interview at a hospital where he was recovering. \u201cAnd her blood was flowing like a river.\u201dTetiana\u2019s leg was ripped apart, and a bullet had torn through his arm. Still, he was able to pull her to safety. She was recovering in a room with seven other heavily injured women. They were alive, but their lives were shattered.\u201cIn old age, I was left with nothing,\u201d Viktor said.Even after two years of unfathomable violence, Victoria was not prepared for Russia\u2019s final bid to annihilate her city.Residents on Chernyshevskoho Street, near the entrance of the city, she said, \u201cwere bombed so badly that people just wrapped themselves in white sheets\u201d and wandered out into the open, hoping to find a volunteer to take them out.\u201cPeople were dying there every day,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do to escape, no basement, nothing.\u201d\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t leave,\u201d she said, \u201cI would just go crazy.\u201dShe was one of the last people to make it out of Avdiivka, on Feb. 2, before evacuation became impossible.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAt least 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed fighting back against the Russian invasion that began two years ago, Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday, providing the first official death toll from Kyiv in more than a year.\"31,000 Ukrainian troops have been killed in this war. Not 300,000, not 150,000... (Russian president Vladimir) Putin is lying there... But nevertheless, this is a big loss for us,\" he said in a news conference at the Ukraine Year Forum in Kyiv.Mr Zelensky said Russia\u2019s casualties \u2013 both injured and dead \u2013 during the invasion stood at 500,000, of which 180,000 were Russian soldiers killed in the war, according to Kyiv\u2019s estimates.\"I won\u2019t say how many wounded (Ukrainians) there are because Russia will know how many people have left the battlefield,\" he said.Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has rejected the tolls provided by Ukraine. Russia has not shared its own tally of Russian soldiers killed and wounded in the two-year-long invasion of Ukraine, and treats the information as a classified state secret.Mr Zelensky added that \u201ctens of thousands of civilians\u201d had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but said that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many of our civilians they killed. We don\u2019t,\u201d he said.In the last update at the end of 2022, Mr Zelensky\u2019s aide Mykhailo Podolyak had said 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the invasion on 24 February in that year.According to a joint report by Russia media outlets Meduza and Mediazona, at least 83,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the continuing invasion.The war, now in its third year, has seen Russia throw huge numbers of soldiers into grinding battles for strategic footholds along the frontline, such as Bakhmut in the earlier stages of the conflict or more recently the eastern city of Avdiivka.Mr Zelensky predicted the war is set to enter a fresh phase as he warned of a new offensive from Russia likely starting in late May or the summer.\"We will prepare for their assault. Their assault that began on 8 October has not brought any results, I believe. We, for our part, will prepare our plan and follow it,\" Mr Zelensky said, speaking to reporters in Kyiv.He added that Kyiv has a clear plan to counter Russian forces but did not share details over fears of compromising the military counteroffensive.\"There is a plan, the plan is clear, I can\u2019t tell you the details,\" he said.Ukraine\u2019s war effort, he said, depended on Western support, which has slowed significantly in recent months. He said the European Union had only supplied 30 per cent of the 1 million ammunition shells that were promised so far.Mr Zelensky said he was nonetheless confident that the US Congress would approve a major new batch of military and financial assistance and that Ukraine needed that decision within a month.More aboutRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraineKyivJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Zelensky says 31,000 Ukraine soldiers killed but Russia loses 180,000Zelensky says 31,000 Ukraine soldiers killed but Russia loses 180,000Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky answers media questions during his press conference in KyivAP\u2715Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Reporting |                    QiOSKqiosk ukraine warJim LobeFeb 22, 2024Europeans have become increasingly pessimistic about the chances that Ukraine can recover territories that it has lost since the Russian invasion two years ago, according to a new poll of 12 EU member states.And an aggregate average of 41 percent of respondents in the 12 countries said they would prefer that Europe \u201cpush Ukraine towards negotiating a peace with Russia\u201d compared to 31 percent who said Europe \u201cshould support Ukraine in taking back the territories occupied by Russia.\u201dThe poll, which was released by the European Council on Foreign Relations Wednesday, was conducted during the first half of January, before the latest advances by Russian forces in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, notably in their takeover of the town of Avdiivka, which is likely to add to the impression that Kyiv is increasingly on the defensive.The survey interviewed a total of more than 17,000 adults in the 12 countries, which included Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden.It found that continued support for Ukraine\u2019s war aims was strongest in Sweden, Portugal, and Poland where pluralities of respondents said Europe should support Kyiv\u2019s efforts to take back its territory. Support was weakest in Austria, Romania, Italy, Greece, and Hungary, where significant pluralities or large majorities in the five countries said Europe should focus on achieving a negotiated settlement. In France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Germany, opinion was more divided between the two alternatives.The poll\u2019s results offered a marked contrast to previous polling by ECFR, according to Ivan Krastev and Mark Leonard, co-authors of a report released with the survey. In June 2022, ECFR found that many Europeans favored a quick resolution to the war, even if that meant Ukraine would have to give up territory. But buoyed by Ukraine\u2019s battlefield successes in regaining territory one year later, a subsequent poll in 2023 found that a plurality of respondents in nine EU countries that were surveyed at the time wanted to support Ukraine\u2019s war aims and believed they were achievable.\u201cNow, in the aftermath of Ukraine\u2019s disappointing counteroffensive and amid flagging support in Western capitals, some of that optimism seems to have dissipated,\u201d according to the two co-authors.Indeed, an aggregate average of only ten percent of respondents in the new poll now believe that Ukraine will defeat Russia, while twice as many, or 20 percent, believe that Moscow will prevail. Across all countries, a plurality of respondents (37 percent on average) believes that a compromise settlement between the two countries will be the most likely outcome.The survey also queried respondents on the impact of a possible victory by former president Donald Trump in November\u2019s U.S. elections on the Ukraine war. An aggregate average of 43 percent of respondents said a new Trump presidency would make a Ukrainian victory \u201cless likely.\u201d Asked what Europe should do if Trump were to end U.S. aid to Ukraine, an aggregate average of 41 percent respondents said they would favor maintaining (21 percent) or increasing (20 percent) aid to Kyiv, while a third of respondents said they would prefer to follow the U.S. in limiting assistance.

Although delays in the delivery of aid to Ukraine have raised Russian hopes, no meaningful changes on the battlefield are near. The Russians cannot drive to Kyiv; the Ukrainians cannot eject the invaders. The first phase of the war in Ukraine is drawing to a close. Both sides are coming closer to acknowledging what has been clear to the rest of the world for quite some time: the current stalemate is unlikely to be broken in any significant way.

(Stringer/Reuters)Listen5 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveAs top Russian and Ukrainian generals assess the battlefield after nearly two brutal years of stalemated \u201cpositional\u201d warfare, they draw the same lessons: Tanks, manned aircraft and traditional maneuver forces are sitting ducks, while advanced drones and digital battle-management systems can have a decisive impact.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightRussia has come to realize what Ukraine recognized more than a year ago: This is an \u201calgorithm war,\u201d one where digital intelligence and targeting systems have rewritten the rules of conflict. The \u201cfog of war\u201d experienced by commanders for centuries has cleared. In the newly transparent battlespace, movements by large units are instantly visible and vulnerable.This look into Russian and Ukrainian military assessments is possible thanks to commentaries published in the past two weeks by two veteran commanders, Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, a former chief of the Russian general staff, and Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, head of the Ukrainian military. They appeared, respectively, in Army Standard, a Russian publication, and on the website of the Ukrainian defense ministry.AdvertisementThe commentaries were flagged to me by Kevin Ryan, a retired Army brigadier general who served as U.S. defense attach\u00e9 in Moscow and then taught at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center. He translated the articles and circulated them this week among Russia specialists. Zaluzhny made similar comments about the importance of drones in an interview published in November in the Economist, but the Russian analysis is new and startling.Follow\u00a0this authorDavid Ignatius's opinionsFollow\u201cThese two adversaries see many of the same lessons,\u201d Ryan writes in an email summarizing the commentaries. The generals recognize that in the Ukraine battlespace, \u201cno concentration of troops, large or small, can escape the ever-present reconnaissance by unmanned aerial systems and satellites,\u201d he notes.The tactical revolution underway in Ukraine underlines why a congressional failure to approve continued U.S. military support for Kyiv would be so devastating. As Russia gains increasing mastery of digital warfare, Zaluzhny worries that Ukraine is hobbled by \u201cexhaustion of our partners\u2019 stocks of missiles and ammunition\u201d and \u201cthe difficulty of our allies in determining the priorities of support.\u201dAdvertisementBaluyevsky\u2019s comments read like a wake-up call to his fellow Russian officers. He argues that the so-called special military operation in Ukraine has been \u201can unprecedented test of literally all components of military affairs and military construction.\u201d His analysis came in the foreword for an anthology of essays about the war, which was then summarized in Army Standard by Russian journalist Sergey Valchenko.Baluyevsky echoes many Western commentators who have argued that defense has trumped offense in Ukraine. \u201cAir defense has won an unexpected triumph over military aviation,\u201d which has \u201clost the ability to operate en masse over enemy territory\u201d and even must fly \u201cwith caution over its own territory.\u201dThe tank \u201chas become one of the main casualties of the combat experience of the last two years,\u201d he explains, since it was \u201can easily detected and easily hit target\u201d and \u201cturned out to be very vulnerable to mines.\u201d Similarly, \u201cthe impossibility of concentrating troops \u2026 forces us to conduct combat operations with small units and separate combat vehicles.\u201dAdvertisementBaluyevsky has some scathing comments about the performance of Russian weapons. \u201cThe qualitative superiority of NATO artillery is evident,\u201d he contends. Ukraine \u201chas revealed a significant lag in Russian artillery and missile systems and requires their priority radical rearmament in the next few years.\u201dThe winners in this war are drones. \u201cUnmanned aircraft have rapidly and unconditionally conquered the airspace,\u201d Baluyevsky argues. Zaluzhny agrees that \u201cunmanned systems, along with other new types of weapons, are almost the only tool for getting out of\u201d the stalemate of trench warfare.Zaluzhny bemoans Russia\u2019s manpower advantage and Ukraine\u2019s \u201cinability \u2026 to improve the state of staffing of the Defense Forces without the use of unpopular measures,\u201d such as a nationwide draft. His disagreement with President Volodymyr Zelensky about the need for such an all-out mobilization is one reason for recent tension between the two men \u2014 and Zelensky\u2019s reported readiness to sack his commander.AdvertisementUkraine, as I wrote after visiting Kyiv in October, is exhausted by war and slowly bleeding out. Zaluzhny implicitly recognizes this war fatigue in arguing for increased use of unmanned systems to \u201creduce the level of losses \u2026 reduce the degree of participation of traditional means of destruction \u2026 [and] limited involvement of heavy equipment.\u201dThe lesson for the United States, beyond the simple but urgent need to continue military assistance for Ukraine, is to focus that support on the high-tech weapons that matter. The weapons that have generated endless debate, such as tanks and F-16 fighters, are less important than drones, antiaircraft systems and electronic-warfare jammers.The best weapons today, agree the Russian and Ukrainian generals, might be small, cheap systems such as \u201cfirst-person view,\u201d or FPV drones that fly into targets like tiny suicide bombers and can be almost impossible to stop. The chilling fact is that these silent killers can be bought and used by almost any combatant, anywhere on Earth. It is, as the generals agree, a new day in warfare.Share CommentsPopular opinions articlesHAND CURATEDOpinion|Roosevelt fixed his serious VP mistake.

Sign up as a client Ukraine war two years on \u2013 the view from Western Europe and the USMatthew SmithHead of Data Journalism Politics & current affairs International February 22, 2024, 9:38 AM GMT+0  Share  Printable version Attitudes remain largely the same as they were at the time of the first anniversary of the invasionAs we approach the second anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the military situation in the beleaguered nation looks much the same now as it did a year ago.This stalemate on the battlefield is mirrored in public opinion, with a new YouGov EuroTrack + US study (conducted in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, as well as the United States) finding attitudes unchanged from a year ago.Two years into the war, should the West encourage negotiations or support Ukraine until Russia quits?Resolve is strongest in Sweden, Denmark and the UK, where 50-57% think the approach should be to support Ukraine until Russia is beaten. More than four in ten Americans (43%) say the same. In each of these four countries, those willing to stand by Ukraine significantly outnumber those who want to encourage a negotiated peace, at 21-27%.Italians tend to take the opposite view, preferring a negotiated peace even if it left Russia still in control of parts of Ukraine by 45% to 28%.The French, German and Spanish publics are all closely divided.Two years into the Ukraine war, how much do Western Europeans and Americans care who wins?There are likewise great differences between countries regarding how far people care who wins the war in Ukraine. Swedes care the most, with 82% saying it matters to them \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d who wins the war, including a majority (53%) who care a great deal.In Britain, 70% say they care who wins, as do 64% in the USA.At the other end of the scale, only 46% of Italians say the outcome of the war matters much to them.Relatively few in any nation surveyed actively want Russia to win \u2013 Germans (14%), French people and Italians (both 11%) are the most likely to say so.While most people in each country want Ukraine to win, the numbers differ significantly, ranging from 88% in Denmark and 85% in Sweden to 52% in Italy. In the UK that figure stands at 79% and in the US it is 72%.Two years on, is the West doing enough to prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine?Across all eight countries surveyed, the belief is that the West is not providing enough support to Ukraine to help them ultimately repel their Russian adversaries. Swedes and Spaniards are the most likely to say so (both 64%) and Germans the least likely (44%). A majority of Britons (57%) likewise think the West is not doing enough, as do 46% of Americans.Americans and Germans are the most likely to think that Ukraine is getting enough assistance, at 25-26%.Two years into the war, what kind of support are Western Europeans and Americans willing to provide Ukraine?While most across the West want Ukraine to win, and acknowledge that there is not enough support being given in order to make that happen, that does not equate to willingness to provide additional support.Given the option to maintain, increase, or reduce aid to the beleaguered nation, the most common preference in each country surveyed is for the former, at 37-50% (except in Germany, where the 30% who want to maintain support levels are outweighed marginally by the 34% who want to reduce them).Swedes are the most likely to want to send more support, at 30%.In the USA, where recent attempts to get Congress to approve further funding for Ukraine have stalled, the public are relatively split \u2013 23% want to send more support, 33% want to maintain current levels, and 26% want to reduce support.When it comes to the kind of support people are willing to back, top of the list are 'maintain the current sanctions regime' (48-76%) and 'imposing further economic sanctions on Russian interests in each country' (44-70%).There is also relatively strong support for sending additional weaponry and supplies to Ukraine (46-70%), although Italy is a notable outlier, with only 29% willing to back this move. In fact, fewer than 50% of Italians support any of the measures we tested.Taking military action in Russia gathers the least in each country. Only between 13-33% support sending troops into Ukraine, and 19-38% back air strikes against Russian targets in the country.Support for each measure has remained relatively static over the last year; in none of the European countries surveyed (the US has not been asked this question previously) has support for any measure increased by more than six points or fallen by more than four.Nevertheless, compared to the first round of results, shortly after the invasion in 2022, enthusiasm for several of the measures is particularly diminished in Germany and Italy. These two countries are typically the least likely to want to give support to Ukraine.Two years into the Ukraine war, which side do Europeans and Americans think has the advantage?Compared to a year ago, Europeans are now more likely to think that Russia has the advantage in the conflict. In most countries there has been a 9-14 point increase in this belief, except in Italy where it has grown by a slower rate of four points.Nevertheless, the most common opinion in most country is that neither side has the advantage, at between 39-48%. Spain is an exception (as it was last year), with most Spaniards saying the Russians have the advantage (58%) and only 24% believing neither side has the upper hand.Americans likewise are more likely to say that Russia has the upper hand (36%) than seeing a stalemate (30%).Only 3-9% think Ukraine is in the stronger position.With the war two years old, Europeans and Americans tend to think the conflict has at least another year to goUnsurprisingly, given the results of the prior question, the most common belief (49-72%) is that the war has at least another war to run. This is up 4-12pts compared to last year in the European countries (the US was not surveyed last year).Expectations that Ukraine will triumph over the next twelve months stand at only 9-13%, down slightly from last year. Few also expect that Russia will finally conquer Ukraine in the coming year, at 5-13%, effectively unchanged since 2023.See the full results herePhoto: Getty Explore more data & articles UkraineUkraine - Russia WarWar & Conflict How should the West respond to a nuclear attack?

Here, we examine language choice and tweeting activity of Ukrainian citizens based on 4,453,341 geo-tagged tweets from 62,712 users before and during the Russian war in Ukraine, from January 2020 to October 2022. Using statistical models, we disentangle sample effects, arising from the in- and outflux of users on Twitter (now X), from behavioural effects, arising from behavioural changes of the users. We observe a steady shift from the Russian language towards Ukrainian already before the war, which drastically speeds up with its outbreak. We attribute these shifts in large part to users\u2019 behavioural changes. Notably, our analysis shows that more than half of the Russian-tweeting users switch towards Ukrainian with the Russian invasion. We interpret these findings as users\u2019 conscious choice towards a more Ukrainian (online) identity and self-definition of being Ukrainian.Similar content being viewed by othersOnline images amplify gender biasArticleOpen access14 February 2024Douglas Guilbeault, Sol\u00e8ne Delecourt, \u2026 Ethan NadlerGlobally representative evidence on the actual and perceived support for climate actionArticleOpen access09 February 2024Peter Andre, Teodora Boneva, \u2026 Armin FalkMaking cities mental health friendly for adolescents and young adultsArticleOpen access21 February 2024Pamela Y. Collins, Moitreyee Sinha, \u2026 Lian ZeitzIntroductionSocial media is critically important in today\u2019s society1,2,3. In recent years, it has played a key role in a number of political shifts and crises4,5. While social media has been found to amplify all manners of misinformation, propaganda, populism, and xenophobia6,7,8, it can also serve as a mechanism to call for aid and as a source for live updates of major events unfolding9,10,11,12.In this article, we analyse language use of Ukrainian citizens on social media before and during the Russian invasion of Ukraine (subsequently referred to as war), where after years of tensions and open aggression between Russia and Ukraine13, on 24th February 2022, Russian forces began to invade and occupy parts of Ukraine14. At the time of writing, it has been estimated that the war has led to over 23,000 civilian casualties15 and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damage16,17. This has caused worldwide unrest, alongside 8.2 million Ukrainian refugees recorded across Europe and 5 million registered for temporary protection18,19.The war in Ukraine is also taking place in the digital era, with social media coverage documenting the horrific events in up to real-time. This provides a unique digital trace of many first-hand accounts of the war, as citizens are communicating among each other and to the public. This is generally known as crisis informatics, whereby social media data are utilized before, during, or after emergency events for use cases such as disaster monitoring, management, and prevention9,12,20,21,22. Recent studies have demonstrated that tweets can capture events of political violence23 and can help in monitoring and understanding intra-country conflicts24.In our work, the user\u2019s choice of language in a tweet is of particular interest. Many people across the world (including most Ukrainian citizens with the Russian and Ukrainian language25) are multilingual. This multilingualism comes with a number of links to an individual\u2019s identity, as someone may speak one language at work, but another one at home with their family. Thus, different languages are spanning across multiple facets of one\u2019s identity26. These context-based adaptations of our self-presentation and behaviour are expected by those around us27,28,29,30. Hence, it is important to note that a user\u2019s choice of language online can be argued as an active choice to communicate and a way they seek to present themselves to their audience26. For example, many non-natives switch to English in order to ensure a wider intelligibility online31.The use of language is also inherently political. Languages can be the cause of conflict and they are often incorporated in cultural and ethnic identity definition and are the basis for nation building and political change32,33. After the dissolution of the USSR, most post-soviet countries introduced new language laws in order to assert their original native language and build a new nation32,34. In Ukraine, after their independence, many people were considering themselves Russians by nationality or Ukrainian with Russian as their main native language35,36. While the government aimed to reverse those effects, they were only moderately successful in achieving this goal, as census results show35,36,37. Only more recently, with the Euromaidan protests and the Russian military intervention in Crimea and the Donbas, surveys between 2012 and 2017 show a consistent and substantial shift away from Russian ethnic and linguistic identification towards Ukrainian practice37.We investigate language choice and tweeting activity on Ukrainian Twitter (now called X) from January 2020 to November 2022 using over 4 million geo-tagged tweets from more than 62,000 different users. In doing this, we study how Ukrainian citizens (and non-citizens living there) respond to their country being aggressively attacked and invaded by its direct neighbour they share a long history and language with, and how the use of language evolved before and during this war. Our study allows us to follow the same set of users and observe their (change in) behaviour over both the short- and longer-term as the war breaks out and continues to unfold on an individual level. Hence, we are able to comment on recent news articles outlining shifts in language use from Russian to Ukrainian as a direct result of the war38,39. Moreover, we are able to monitor long-term language trends even before the war without the necessity of relying on small-scale surveys nor the infrequent censuses, the last one of which was conducted in 2001.More specifically, we study overall trends in the number of tweets in the three main languages (Ukrainian, Russian, English) over time. Second, we investigate how these trends translate to users\u2019 individual tweeting activity and if changes result from the in- and outflux of users, common in online communities40,41,42, or if they result from users changing their behaviour over time43,44,45. We quantify the magnitude of both effects respectively. Third, we study if changes in users\u2019 tweeting activity originate from shifts between languages and quantify the magnitude of these shifts. Fourth and finally, we take a closer look at those users that switch from predominately tweeting in Russian to predominately tweeting in Ukrainian with the outbreak of the war.MethodsThis study was ethically approved by the ethics commission of the faculty of mathematics, computer science and statistics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (LMU) M\u00fcnchen, Germany. The reference identifier is EK-MIS-2022-127. We did not preregister this study. No information on user demographics such as age, sex, gender or race were collected or determined and - in accordance with the ethics commission - no informed consent by the Twitter users was obtained.DataData collection & final datasetWe collected tweets from 9th January 2020 to 12th October 2022 using the 1% real-time stream of the Twitter API. During collection, we filtered the data such that we only gathered tweets containing geo-information from the API. We then manually filtered the dataset to only retain tweets from Ukraine (denoted by the \u201cUA\u201d country tag), as common in the literature46, and excluded any retweets, which left us with primary tweets, quotes and replies, all of which contain original tweet texts.This dataset obtained from the 1% stream consisted of 4,102,982 tweets. As we began cleaning, we noticed gaps with missing tweets, most likely due to server and internet outages during the real-time data collection process. Hence, we retrospectively identified and filled all gaps. To do this, we first identified all time windows\u2009>10 min without any tweet and added them to our download queue. Days with more than two of such time windows were added to the queue as a whole. We then queried the Twitter Research API 2.0 using the tweets/search/all endpoint to obtain tweets with Ukrainian geoinformation for all time windows in this queue and added the newly obtained tweets to our original dataset. Finally, we repeated this process for the 15 days with the least amount of tweets in our dataset. After removing all duplicates, this meant we added a total of 350,359 additional tweets to our dataset this way. Our subsequently conducted sensitivity analysis shows that through the two-stage filtering process combined with the recollection efforts, we were able to recover almost all geo-tagged tweets from Ukraine during this time period (see section \u201cSensitivity Analysis\u201d for more info).We conducted an extensive spam filtering scheme, in which we (1) removed any duplicate tweets, (2) identified and removed potential spam bots by training a bot detection model following47, (3) removed users with >100 tweets per day, (4) only kept tweets coming from official Twitter clients or Instagram, and (5) applied additional filtering rules specific to our dataset. This reduced our dataset from originally 4,453,341 tweets (62,712 users) down to 2,845,670 tweets (41,696 users). For a more extensive description and rationale see section \u201cData Cleaning\u201d.User characteristicsUnsurprisingly, social media is popular in Ukraine, particularly among the younger generation, with almost all citizens aged 18-39 in 2021 reporting that they use social media. For Twitter, user statistics are as follows: 18\u201329 (13% usage), 30\u201339 (8%), 40\u201349 (7%), 50+ (1%)48.We provide an overview and descriptive statistics on all user attributes as available from the API in Supplementary Table\u00a04. The relevant user attributes for our main results and their assigned names are described in the following. Followers are the number of accounts that follow a user. Followings reports the number of accounts a user is following. The account age the number of months a user account has existed from account creation to their latest tweet in our dataset. The tweet frequency the number of tweets per day. The like frequency the number of liked tweets (by the user) per day. # of Tweets in Ukraine reports the total number of tweets in our dataset. All Twitter user attributes are a snapshot from the last time we observe a user\u2019s respective tweet in our sample.As described in Supplementary Notes\u00a01, we conduct multilingual topic modelling using BERTopic49. War topic 1 reports the number of tweets assigned to first war topic cluster (topic #1), which covers updates about the war and calls for help. War topic 1 (rel.) the relative share of tweets assigned to this topic. War topic 2 reports the number of tweets assigned to second war topic cluster (topic #3), which covers a more political side of the overall conflict. War topic 2 (rel.) the relative share. A full list of all topic clusters is available in Supplementary Table\u00a01.Sensitivity analysisAfter data collection (before the cleaning), we evaluated the completeness of the dataset, i.e. whether we were able to recover most of the tweets published in Ukraine over the course of the study period, using the following strategy. We draw a random subset of 29 days from our analysis period and draw tweets from the Twitter Research API 2.0 using the tweets/search/all endpoint, which returns all historic tweets that have not been deleted since. We find a coverage of 98.24% (SD: 3.09%). More importantly, in the opposite direction we are only able to report a coverage of 77.67% (SD: 9.55%). Hence, employing our strategy using the real-time stream offers substantially more tweets, which have been deleted since (for more information on tweet deletion and its effects see ref. 50). Moreover, this suggests we were able to recover most of the geo-tagged tweets from Ukraine.Data cleaningFor cleaning our dataset, we first train a Twitter bot detection model using a random forest (RF), as described in ref. 47. We use the exact same model as described in the authors\u2019 work (except for removing the attribute profile_use_background_image, which is no longer available from the Twitter API), using the training datasets botometer-feedback, celebrity, political-bots, as well as 100 manually labelled Twitter accounts from our dataset. To evaluate performance, we first set up a nested cross validation (CV) routine, with both a fivefold CV in the inner and outer loop. The inner CV is used for hyperparameter tuning, tuning both the number of trees as well as the minimum node size of the RF, whereas the outer loop is used for evaluating model performance. This results in an average area under the receicer operator characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.9837 and an average area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.7707. For our final model, we replicate this procedure, by setting up a 5-fold CV on the entire dataset to find the best performing hyperparameters. We then train our RF on the entire dataset and use this model to identify bots and spam accounts in our dataset.As we are only interested in removing the most prevalent spam, we opt for a conservative removal strategy to not falsely remove too many real and non-spam users. Hence, we only remove users with a predicted bot probability\u2009>50% and more than 10 tweets since account creation as well as users with a predicted bot probability\u2009>30% and more than 10,000 tweets. While thresholds of 50% and 30% respectively might not seem conservative, in the given setting, in which the bot class is heavily underrepresented (3.7% of observations in training dataset), an F1-optimizing threshold on the training dataset would lie far below that. We are somewhat less conservative with users that published over 10000 tweets, as in most cases they are spam accounts (e.g. related to bitcoins or NFTs). We do to not remove users with less than 11 tweets, as even for a human it becomes incredibly difficult to determine if a user is a bot with such limited amount of information to draw from. At the same time, we noticed a large influx of new users after the outbreak of the war who exclusively called for help in a short span of time, a behaviour which can easily be mistaken for a bot. Notably, we do not tune the optimal classification threshold, as the outbreak of the war in Ukraine represents an unprecedented event, with an unusual amount of new users joining (see Section \u201cUser Activity\u201d). Hence, we expect the distribution between the target label (bot or human) and our features to be different between the bot training dataset and our Ukrainian dataset. Unfortunately, an extensive manual labelling strategy and more elaborate bot detection is beyond the scope of this work and would warrant its own paper. In summary, with this strategy we remove a total of 2021 users and their tweets from our dataset.To further identify and remove potential spam accounts, we identify all accounts with more than 100 tweets on a single day (the mean is\u2009~\u20094.4 and the median = 2), and remove those 257 users from the dataset. We also noticed an unusual amount of Tweets containing the word \u201cBTS\u201d (45,579; referring to the Korean K-Pop band51) with spikes on specific days, which we subsequently filter out. Next, we identify and remove any tweets published by the same user that contain the exact same text as their previous tweet if both tweets were published within a one minute window. Fifth and finally, we filter out any tweets with the source attribute not being equal to Instagram or Twitter. That way, we discard any tweets automatically published by social media schedulers such as dlvr, which are often used by news agencies or other companies.Statistical modellingTweet modellingWe define the number of tweets Yt,u,l made in week t by user u in language l. As tweets are count data, we model the Yt,u,l to follow a Poisson distribution with intensity \u03bbt,u,l, where$${\\lambda }_{t,u,l}=\\exp (\\mu +{s}_{l}(t)+{W}_{u,l}).$$                    (1)                Here, \u03bc is a general time-constant intercept, which captures the average tweet intensity over all users, languages and weeks. The Wu,l are language-specific time-constant random intercepts for each user u, assumed to be normally distributed. They capture by how much the average tweeting behaviour (more or less tweets) of each user in each language differs from the general mean \u03bc. Finally, sl(t) denotes a smooth global time trend for each language l (Ukrainian, Russian, English) and captures changes in the tweeting behaviour over all users over time. Hence, with the latter, we can measure behavioural changes of the users over time (e.g. are users tweeting more with the outbreak of the war?), whereas the random intercepts measure changes in the user sample over time (e.g. are users that enter the platform after the war tweeting more on average?). This results in a generalized additive mixel model (GAMM). For more information, we refer the reader to ref. 52 and ref. 53. We fit the model with the R package mgcv v1.8.4154 using the GAM implementation for very large datasets bam. To speed up the estimation, we use the discrete option, which discretizes covariates to ease storage and increase efficiency. For fitting sl(t), we employ thin plate regression splines. Our estimation sample consists of y = 1,045,245 observations, with t = 143 weeks, l = 3 languages and u = 13,643 users. For our fitted model, we report an explained deviance of 71.3%.The effect sizes in the results are calculated as follows. For the behavioural effects we derive the change in sl(t) between two respective dates t1 and t2 and take the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp ({s}_{l}({t}_{2})-{s}_{l}({t}_{1}))\\) for each language l. The result is the change in expected tweeting activity due to behavioural changes, when controlling for the in- and outflux of users. The sample effects are derived by averaging the random effects of the active users at the two respective dates and taking the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp ({\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{2},l}-{\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{1},l})\\). We define \\({\\overline{W}}_{t,l}\\) as the average random effect in language l over all users u active at time point t. This captures the averaged change in expected tweeting activity due to a change in average tweeting intensity of the active users, when controlling for behavioural changes.Language modellingTo model users\u2019 pairwise language probability, we refrain from a multinomial modelling strategy, as even with a weekly setup our dataset is particularly large. (To the best of our knowledge, a package with a parallel estimation routine for large datasets that can fit a GAMM for a multinomial distribution does not exist.) Instead, we model each pairwise probability separately through a binomial distribution. Our pairwise evaluation gives us a total of three different language pairs (UA over RU, UA over EN, RU over EN), for which we model the probability \u03c0 to tweet in language one (subsequently l1) over language two (subsequently l2). The order in which we specify these pairs is irrelevant, as the probability to tweet in l2 over l1 is simply 1\u2009\u2212\u2009\u03c0. More specifically, we define Xt,u as the number of tweets made in week t by user u in l1. We assume Xt,u\u2009~\u2009Binomial(nt,u,\u2009\u03c0t,u), where nt,u denotes the total number of tweets made by user u in week t (sum of tweets in l1 and l2) and \u03c0t,u corresponds to the probability to tweet in l1 over l2. We assume that nt,u is known and instead model \u03c0t,u by setting$${\\pi }_{t,u}=f(\\mu +s(t)+{W}_{u}),$$                    (2)                where f(.\u2009) is defined as the logistic function. Similarly to before, \u03bc is a general time-constant intercept, which captures the average mean probability over all users and weeks to tweet in l1 over l2. Again, the Wu are time-constant random intercepts for each user u that capture by how much the average probability differs from the general mean \u03bc, and are assumed to be normally distributed. The smooth global time trend s(t) captures changes in the probability over all users over time. Hence, as before, we can measure behavioural changes of the users over time with the latter (are users actively changing the language they are tweeting in?), whereas the random intercepts measure changes in the sample over time (how does the language probability of users entering/leaving the platform evolve?). We estimate this model specification for all three aforementioned language-pairs with the R package mgcv v1.8.4154 using the GAM implementation for very large datasets bam. To speed up the estimation, we use the discrete option, which discretizes covariates to ease storage and increase efficiency. For fitting s(t), we employ thin plate regression splines. Users not tweeting in either of the two languages of the respective language pair, need to be discarded by definition. Hence, for UA over RU our estimation sample consists of of x = 194,178 observations, with t = 143 weeks and u = 10,531 users. For UA over EN: x = 146,984, t = 143, u = 9,133. For RU over EN: x = 170,853, t = 143, u = 10777. For our fitted models, we report explained deviances of: 85.8% (UA over RU), 90.5% (UA over EN) and 90% (RU over EN).The coefficients of a logistic regression, as employed here, must be interpreted with respect to changes in the odds (also known as odds ratio). The odds ratio is defined as odds\u2009=\u2009p/(1\u2009\u2212\u2009p). Hence, it describes how likely an event is going to happen compared to not happen. In this setting, it describes how likely it is to tweet in language 1 over language 2.The effect sizes in the results are calculated as follows. For the behavioural effects we derive the change in s(t) between two respective dates t1 and t2 and take the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp (s({t}_{2})-s({t}_{1}))\\) for each of the three models. The result is the change in odds to tweet in l1 over l2 due to behavioural changes, when controlling for the in- and outflux of users. The sample effects are derived by averaging the random effects of the active users at the two respective dates and taking the \\(\\exp (.)\\), i.e. \\(\\exp ({\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{2}}-{\\overline{W}}_{{t}_{1}})\\) for each of the three models. We define \\({\\overline{W}}_{t}\\) as the average random effect over all users u active at time point t. This captures the averaged change in odds due to a change in average tweeting probability of the active users, when controlling for behavioural changes.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.ResultsDescriptive findingsTo determine the language of a tweet, in accordance with the literature55,56, we utilize the language field provided by the Twitter API. Ukrainian (35.8%) and Russian (35.4%) tweets are most prevalent in our dataset, followed by English (11.5%). A large proportion of tweets (11.1%) is labelled as \u201cundefined\u201d, which among others consists of tweets that are too short, contain only hashtags, or only have media links. All other languages have shares of 1.2% or less. For the subsequent analysis we focus on tweets coming from the three main languages (English, Russian, Ukrainian) and discard all remaining tweets. A full breakdown of the language distribution is reported in Supplementary Figure\u00a06.In our dataset, there are clear trends in the aggregate over time (Fig.\u00a01). In the beginning of 2020, we can see that Russian is the predominant language being used on Twitter in Ukraine, however, over time, this number gradually declines. The number of Ukrainian and English tweets on the other hand remains more or less constant over this initial time period. In the figure, we mark two key dates. On 11th November 2021, the United States officially report a mobilization of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border for the first time57,58,59. We will subsequently call this the first signs of aggression. 24th February 2022 marks the begin of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (subsequently referred to as outbreak of the war). As we approach this outbreak, there is a clear spike in tweets across all three languages, with a larger spike in both English and Ukrainian. Afterwards, English and Russian remain mostly constant, although the former on a much higher level than before. For Ukrainian, there is a clear upward trend in the daily number of tweets after the outbreak of the war.Fig. 1: Daily number of tweets in the three most common languages.Russian in red, Ukrainian in blue, English in green. From 9th January to 12th October (1008 days).\u00a0The first vertical line denotes the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border (11th November 2021). The second line denotes the outbreak of the war (24th February 2022).Full size imageGiven these remarkable shifts in the number of tweets in the three considered languages, we want to investigate the underlying factors contributing to these changes. Note, that from the aggregate trends, we can not distinguish whether the observed patterns are due to large in- and outfluxes of users, i.e. user turnover, which are common in online communities40,41,42, or whether the actively tweeting users change their behaviour over time43,44,45. The disentanglement of this question is the aim of the rest of this article.User activityIn order to address this question, we restructure our dataset by aggregating the number of tweets made by each user in English (EN), Ukrainian (UA), and Russian (RU) in each week. (Note, that we employ the Ukrainian country code \u201cUA\u201d instead of the official Ukrainian language tag \u201cUK\u201d in order to avoid confusion.) This allows us to study users\u2019 individual behaviour over time. To obtain reliable results, we restrict the further analysis to users who have tweeted in total at least ten times in any of the three languages. Furthermore, we choose weeks instead of days, as we are interested in general shifts and overall changes in behaviour over time, which are captured sufficiently well on a weekly basis. Through this weekly definition, we can dramatically reduce the size of our dataset, hence more complex modelling approaches become computationally feasible. We drop the first and last week in our dataset as these are incomplete (less than 7 days) and aggregate the remaining tweets on a weekly basis for each user and language. Finally within this, we are only considering weeks in which users are active (we define this as any week in which a user is tweeting at least once, as well as up to two weeks after), in order to account for the times in which users may be inactive for several weeks at a time or abandon their accounts. Thus, our new sample ranges from 13th January 2020 to 10th October 2022 and consists of 143 analysis weeks, 13,643 users and 1,045,245 observations.Using this definition of user activity, we can visualize the total amount of active users as well as turnover rates (switch from active to inactive and vice versa) over time (Fig.\u00a02). In the beginning of 2020, we have around 2800 active users per week. This number gradually decreases to roughly 1,800 until we approach the outbreak of the war. Afterwards, the number of active users starts increasing again. Note the drop and subsequent spike in activity shortly before and with the outbreak of the war. Looking at the turnover rates, we find that there is a constant stream of ~250 (potentially different) users per week that switch from active to inactive and vice versa. The aforementioned spikes are also evident in these turnover rates. Finally, we find that there are roughly 50 users per week that join our sample for the first time and about the same amount that leave it altogether. Both of these numbers almost double after the outbreak of the war.Fig. 2: Weekly user activity graphs.The brown graph reports the number of active users in each week. The blue (red) graph reports the number of users who switch to active (inactive), the green the number of users who switch to active for the first time, the purple the number of users who were active for the last time, i.e. drop out of the sample altogether. All graphs, but particularly the latter two, are skewed upwards respectively downwards towards beginning and end of the study period due to the nature of how the dataset is constructed. Hence, we drop the first and last three weeks for visualization purposes (137 total weeks left). The full plot is available in Supplementary Notes\u00a05.Full size imageTweeting activityTo obtain a better understanding on how the average active Ukrainian Twitter user changes over time, we visualize the average number of published tweets by a user in each language in Fig.\u00a03a. From the figure, we can clearly see that there are substantial shifts. Overall, the average number of RU tweets per user decreases constantly over time (from over 6.5 to 2.1), the outbreak of the war being no exception. The average number of EN tweets decreases slightly until the war, where we notice a sudden uptick (from 0.7 to 2.8), followed by a steady decline. Meanwhile, the number of UA tweets slowly but steadily rises (from 2.4 to 2.9), with steeper increases after the first signs of aggression in November 2021 and no appearance of slowing down (5.3 at the end).Fig. 3: Changes in the number of tweets per user.Russian in red, Ukrainian in blue, English in green. (a) visualizes the descriptive average number of tweets over time, (b) the sample effects (average random effects), (c) the behavioural effects (global trend). The shaded area depicts the 95% confidence interval. The first vertical line denotes the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border. The second line denotes the outbreak of the war.Full size imageBy combining these findings with Fig.\u00a02, we can at least partially explain the aggregate trends evident in Fig.\u00a01. While the active user sample is shrinking over time, those users that stay (and join) the sample are tweeting more in UA. Hence, there is no decrease in the overall amount of UA tweets. We find the exact opposite for RU tweets. As the number of active users is declining, the users that stay active are tweeting less in RU, resulting in the visible decrease of aggregate RU tweets over time. Notably, so far, we do not know, if those changes in the average amount of tweets per user are simply driven by shifts in our active user sample (i.e., are those users that initially tweet a lot in RU leaving over time and this is why we see this decrease in the average?), or, if these changes are (at least partially) driven by behavioural changes in those users that remain active on Twitter (i.e., are the same users tweeting less in RU over time?).We address this through our tweet model described in Section \u201cTweet Modelling\u201d. We fit a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to predict the number of tweets made by each user in each language in each week, assuming a Poisson distribution. By incorporating both a smooth global time trend for each language, as well as user-specific random effects for each of the languages, we disentangle sample shifts (random effects) from behavioural changes (global trend). Hence, the former capture any changes in the population of active Ukraine-based Twitter users, while the latter strictly measures how these active users change their behaviour.Figure\u00a03b visualizes the average fitted sample (population) effects, i.e. the graphs depict how the average time-constant tweeting intensity in our active user sample changes over time due to user turnover. The figure shows, that the average RU tweeting intensity is mostly constant over time until November 2021, where aggression starts. From that point onward, in the span of only a few months, we see a decline of 21% in RU tweets from November 2021 to October 2022 (end of study period), solely attributed to changes in the user sample during that period. For EN, we find somewhat of an opposite effect. Similarly, there are only minor fluctuations until November 2021. But afterwards, there is a sharp increase of 107%. Taking a look at UA, we find a long-term increase of about 43% before the aggression starts. This increase comes to a hold shortly before the war, and considerably speeds up in the weeks after (+87%). All (relative) effect sizes calculated between the most relevant dates in our analysis period (start of study period, first signs of aggression, outbreak of war, end of study period) are reported in Table\u00a01. We elaborate on this in Supplementary Notes\u00a06, where we provide an additional figure, which illustrates sample changes over four-weekly intervals (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09). From there, we can observe that the largest shifts clearly take place with and after the outbreak of the war. We also provide an alternative to Table\u00a01, which measures the speed of change between the key dates in Supplementary Table\u00a05. A full breakdown of all model coefficients is available in Supplementary Table\u00a07.Table 1 Tweet activity effect sizes between key datesFull size tableNext, we will investigate behavioural changes using Fig.\u00a03c. The graphs depict how the tweeting behaviour of the active users changes throughout the study period, when controlling for the user turnover (sample effects). Starting with RU, we notice that users are tweeting less and less over time. From January 2020 to November 2021, users tweet 49% less in RU due to behavioural changes. Subsequently, we see a small rise with the outbreak of the war (+5%), followed up by an even steeper decline (\u221224%). In contrast, UA is reasonably consistent in its use up until the start of aggression. From there, we observe a surge (+36%) until the outbreak of the war, followed by a gentler increase (+15%) after. Finally, looking more closely at EN tweeting behaviour, we can observe a general downward trend (\u221234%) until November 2021. Once the aggression starts, there is a huge spike (+130%), as users are tweeting a lot more in EN. After the outbreak of the war, this somewhat reverses (\u221240%), however, without dropping back down to pre-aggression levels. A full breakdown of all changes is reported in Table\u00a01. Again, we elaborate in in Supplementary Notes\u00a06. Supplementary Figure\u00a09 shows that the largest behavioural shifts take place shortly before, with, and after the outbreak of the war. As a robustness check, we also pursue two alternative modelling strategies, one using factor smooths instead of random intercepts, the other implementing a regression discontinuity design, which are discussed extensively in Supplementary Notes\u00a02.1 and 2.2 respectively. Both confirm the behavioural patterns described here.Overall, we can conclude that there are only minor sample shifts pre-dating aggression that affect tweeting activity, but major shifts thereafter. In terms of behaviour, we can already observe steady changes early on, which considerably intensify with the war. However, as of yet, we cannot exactly pinpoint where those changes come from. Are users that already tweet in UA simply tweeting more with the outbreak of the war, or is it possible that users are actively switching the language they are tweeting in?Choice of languageWe analyze the choice of language more closely in the following. As we are interested in shifts between the individual languages, we look at the pairwise probability to tweet in one language over another over time. Hence, the probability reports how likely it is that a user tweets in language one (e.g. UA) over language two (e.g. EN). With three languages, this pairwise evaluation gives us a total of three different language pairs (UA over RU, UA over EN, RU over EN), where the order in which we specify each pair is irrelevant. Figure\u00a04a visualizes how these pairwise probabilities evolved for an average user over time. For RU over EN the probability is mostly constant (82% to tweet in RU) until aggression starts, from where it continuously drops down to 58%. For UA over EN we see small increases over time (68\u201372%). With the mobilization of the Russian troops, we see a drop (62%), followed by a rise back to pre-aggression levels months into the war. Finally, for UA over RU we see a completely different pattern. Initially, the probability to tweet in UA is low (32%), from where it continues to rise consistently. In the weeks leading up to the war, there is a considerable speed up in this shift, resulting in a probability of 76% to tweet in UA over RU towards the end of the analysis period in October 2022.Fig. 4: Changes in the choice of language per user (RU over EN in brown, UA over EN in turquoise, UA over RU in purple).RU over EN in brown, UA over EN in turquoise, UA over RU in purple. (a) Visualizes the descriptive average probability to tweet in one language over another, (b) the sample effects (average random effects), (c) the behavioural effects (global trend). The shaded area depicts the 95% confidence interval. The first vertical line denotes the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border. The second line denotes the outbreak of the war.Full size imageSimilarly to before, we can disentangle sample shifts from behavioural changes through statistical modelling. In summary, we fit a GAMM to model users\u2019 pairwise language probability to tweet over time, assuming a binomial distribution. As before, we include a smooth global time trend and user-specific random effects into the model. We fit such a model, for all three aforementioned language-pairs. A full description is provided in Section \u201cLanguage Modelling\u201d.Figure\u00a04b visualizes the fitted average sample effects across all three models, i.e. the graphs depict how the average time-constant tweeting probabilities in the active user sample change over time. As we are working with coefficients of a logistic regression, changes must be interpreted with respect to changes in the odds. The figure shows that for RU over EN, initially, there is only a minor decline (\u221219%). However, as we approach the outbreak of the war, we can report a large drop in the odds, as users are 62% less likely to tweet in RU over EN than before, with further decreases thereafter (\u221229%). For UA over EN, we find a small to moderate increase until aggression (+21%) due to sample shifts, followed by a large drop until war outbreak (\u221252%), which is recovered in the months after (+42%). Finally, for UA over RU, there is a constant increase in the odds over time (+66%), which speeds up once aggression starts (+87% until October 2022). Table\u00a02 details all changes. As before, changes over four-weekly intervals are visualized in Supplementary Fig.\u00a010. The figure shows that the sample effects for the language choice are slightly more erratic, but the major shifts take place with and after war outbreak. The alternative to Table\u00a02, with the speed of changes is available in Supplementary Table\u00a06, the full breakdown of all model coefficients in Supplementary Table\u00a08.Table 2 Language choice effect sizes between key datesFull size tableCombining this with the results from the previous section, we can conclude that the user turnover in the first 1.5 years shifts the sample such that users are more likely to tweet in UA (than RU or EN), but not at the expense of either of the two other languages, as the sample effects for tweeting activity are (mostly) steady for both. As we approach the outbreak of the war, this drastically changes. Then, the user sample clearly shifts away from RU, as users are instead tweeting more in EN (initially) and UA (long-term). Upon further investigation (Supplementary Notes\u00a07 and 8), we find that users tweeting in RU start leaving around November 2021 (start of aggression), with EN users joining. The former continue to leave as the war unfolds, with a few of the latter also leaving the sample again over time. This is also reflected in the increase of the UA odds over time (UA over RU consistently, UA over EN as war continues).Figure\u00a04c reports behavioural language changes across all three language pairs, when controlling for the user turnover. For RU over EN we see a constant decline in the odds over time (\u221238% to tweet in RU), which further speeds up once aggression starts (\u221251%). For UA over EN we see the exact opposite, as over time users are more likely to tweet in UA (+64% in odds). This change reverses with the start of aggression and the outbreak of the war (\u221234%), but subsequently reaches pre-aggression levels as the war unfolds. Finally, we can see a clear shift from UA to RU even early on (+129%). This switch becomes even more striking with the outbreak of the war, as users are actively changing their behaviour such that the average user is 249% more likely to tweet in UA over RU in the span of a single year. Table\u00a02 reports all relevant changes. Supplementary Figure\u00a010 similarly illustrates that the biggest behavioural shifts take place around the outbreak of the war, but also that there already is a constant long-term shift from UA towards RU before. Our alternative modelling strategies in Supplementary Notes\u00a02.1 and 2.2 confirm these findings.Connecting these language shifts with the results on tweeting activity, we find that the initial decline in EN and RU tweeting activity is not limited to monolingual users. Instead, users are actively shifting towards UA, by reducing their amount of RU and EN tweets (with a stronger shift from RU than EN respectively). Similarly, the temporary increase in EN tweeting behaviour leading up to the war can be linked to both UA and RU users. Finally and most importantly, the decline of RU and the rise of UA tweeting behaviour that manifests itself with the war is strongly driven by a major language shift (2.5 times increase) from RU to UA.We visualize and demonstrate this substantial behavioural language shift from RU to UA in Figs.\u00a05, 6. Figure\u00a05 plots the language proportion of each user (UA to RU; from 0 to 1) that tweet in either language before (y-axis) and after the war (x-axis). Hence, along the straight black line through the origin we have users that do not switch language (top right UA, bottom left RU), users above the line switch to RU, below the line to UA, with users switching completely from one language to the other being located in either the top left (all tweets in UA to all in RU) or bottom right corner. Statistically significant (p\u2009<\u20090.05, z\u2009>\u20091.96) language shifts from before to after war outbreak are determined using a two-sided z-test with unequal variances on each user\u2019s language proportion, and are marked in the plot (the distributions were assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested). From the figure it becomes evident that there are many users that do not switch language (in both UA and RU), as well as many users clearly switching from RU to UA at various levels, whereas there are only very few switching from UA to RU.Fig. 5: Scatterplot of users\u2019 language proportions before and after the outbreak of the war.We are only considering users who tweet in either RU or UA (or both) before and after (n\u2009=\u20093237). The points are coloured with respect to each user\u2019s shift in language. 1 (orange) denotes a complete shift to UA, \u22121 (green) a complete shift to RU, 0 no shift. The straight line through the origin covers all points without a shift. Significant shifts (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05) using a two-sided z-test with unequal variances on each user\u2019s language proportion are denoted through full (non-empty) points. n\u2009=\u20091808 (821 significant) shifts towards Ukrainian, n = 818 (106 significant) shifts towards Russian. Only RU and UA tweets of each user are considered.Full size imageIn this sample of users who tweet in either RU or UA both before and after the outbreak of the war (3237 users), we have 1363 users who predominately tweet in RU (>80% of tweets) before the war. Of those, 839 (61.6%) tweet more in UA after the war, with 566 (41.5%) reporting a significant behavioural change (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Out of those 850 users, 341 (25%) even switch to predominately tweeting in UA (>80% of tweets), i.e. perform a hard-switch, with 296 (21.7%) statistically significant hard-switches (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). We pick those 296 users and plot their weekly language proportion over time in Fig.\u00a06. Red points denote 100% of the tweets being phrased in RU, blue points denote the same in UA. From the figure, we can clearly see a substantial break and change in behaviour around the time the war breaks out (second black line), as most of the users switch from RU to UA around this mark.Fig. 6: Scatterplot of users\u2019 language proportion in each week over time.Each row (on the y-axis) denotes one of the n\u2009=\u2009295 users with a statistically significant hard-switch from RU to UA. The points are coloured with respect to each user\u2019s language proportion in the respective week (145 total weeks). Blue = 100% Ukrainian, red = 0% Ukrainian (=100% Russian). Missing points indicate that a user was not tweeting in the respective week. Only RU and UA tweets of each user are considered. The first vertical line denotes the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border. The second line denotes the outbreak of the war.Full size imageOn Ukrainian side, we have 1172 users who predominately tweet in UA (>80% of tweets) before the war. Of those, 471 (40.2%) tweet more in RU after the war, with only 83 (7.1%) reporting a significant behavioural change (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). More importantly, we only observe 35 (3%) hard-switches, out of which 20 (1.7%) are significant (z\u2009>\u20091.96, p\u2009<\u20090.05). Hence, there are only very few UA tweeting users for which we can report a significant switch towards RU after the war.Finally, we analyze potential differences in those RU users that perform a hard-switch to UA from those that do not (see Table\u00a03). We find that there are significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in the median in various user characteristics between the two groups using a two-sided chi-squared test (no distributional assumptions required). Users switching have more followers (+54.5%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20098.223, p\u2009=\u20090.004), a higher tweet frequency (+47.7%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20095.352, p\u2009=\u20090.021) as well as a higher like frequency (+48.9%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20095.352, p\u2009=\u20090.021) and published more Ukraine geo-tagged tweets during the study period (+49.1%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u200910.639, p\u2009=\u20090.001), whereas there are only small non-significant differences in account age (+12.2%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20093.196, p\u2009=\u20090.07) and followings (+13.8%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20092.023, p\u2009=\u20090.16).Table 3 Median % differences in user characteristicsFull size tableWe also conduct a multilingual topic modelling on the tweets using BERTopic49. The method and its results are thoroughly described in Supplementary Notes\u00a01. We find two topic clusters referencing the war (topic #1 and topic #3). The former is mostly related to updates regarding the situation, asking for help, and supporting the people of Ukraine, the latter covers a more political side of the overall conflict. Both topics are in total more discussed by those RU users that switch language (+62.5%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u200922.061, p\u2009<\u20090.001; +100%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20097.312, p\u2009=\u20090.007). However, once we control for their total amount of tweets in our dataset, i.e. we compute a relative share of war related tweets for each user, the differences shrink and turn non-significant (+4.71%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20090.063, p\u2009=\u20090.801; +17.6%, \u03c72(1)\u2009=\u20090.543, p\u2009=\u20090.461).DiscussionIn our work, we collected geo-tagged tweets from Ukraine and analyzed tweeting activity and language choice before and during the Russian war in Ukraine from 9th January 2020 to 12th October 2022. Due to the nature of our longitudinal dataset and our methodological approach using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM), we were able to disentangle and quantify shifts in the user sample, arising from user turnover, from behavioural changes of the actively tweeting users. Our GAMMs were able to handle the large sample size and take care of user\u2019s varying periods of inactivity within the study period, while at the same time allowing for a flexible non-linear but interpretable model fit.Our analysis shows a steady long-term shift away from Russian towards Ukrainian already before the war, as the Ukrainian tweet probability rises substantially (vs. Russian; 33% to 48%). This shift is majorly driven by behavioural changes. The actively tweeting users reduce their number of Russian tweets in favour of Ukrainian over time. This is likely a conscious choice and thus shift in how the users communicate and present themselves to their online audience26,27,28,29,31. This finding is also in line with trends observed over a 20-year period between the 1989 and the last conducted census in 200136 and more recently across surveys37, where the share of people reporting Ukrainian as their native language perpetually rose over time. Notably, with the Euromaidan protests and the subsequent Russian military intervention in 2014, this shift seems to have sped up, as citizens ethnonational identification and everyday language use is substantially shifting towards Ukrainian. This recent shift towards Ukrainian has also been identified in a small qualitative study on Facebook posts60. We can confirm these findings quantitatively both at-scale and in an ecologically valid setting.We find this gradual shift to drastically speed up with the start of Russian aggression in November 2021 and the subsequent outbreak of the war. In the span of a few months, Ukrainian tweet probability rises from 48% to a remarkable 76%. While some of this increase can be explained by Russian tweeting users leaving and Ukrainian users joining (+87% in odds to tweet in Ukrainian), the major factor is a behavioural change (+249% in odds to tweet in Ukrainian), with a rise in Ukrainian (+56%) and a decrease in Russian tweeting activity (\u221220%). Notably, we show that out of those users predominately tweeting in Russian before the war, roughly half of them tweet more in Ukrainian after. Strikingly, around a quarter of them switch to predominately tweeting in Ukrainian, i.e., they are performing a hard-switch. It is worth noting, that we do not observe more than a handful of switches in the other direction. This shift from Russian to Ukrainian is in line with news reports and small-scale surveys outlining the war as the cause for the recent changes in language use across Ukraine38,39. We theorize that this is a highly politicized response. Users want to distance themselves from any support of the war by no longer using Russian, and consciously change their self-expressed (online) identity26,27,28,29,31, as also already to some extent reported after the Russian military intervention in 2014 both on- and offline37,60 and confirmed in our study through the gradual shift before the war. However, with the Russian invasion, this shift seems to have sped up massively. Moreover, the distancing from supporting the war may also explain why Russian users that perform a hard-switch to Ukrainian seem to be more active on Twitter (including discussions on the war) and have a larger follower base (median of 119 vs. 77). Pressure and general interactions on social media were already reported among the main reasons for the language switch after 201460. Note, that this might also (partially) explain the sample of active users shifting from Russian towards Ukrainian (sample effects).In addition, we observe a long-term behavioural shift away from English tweeting activity up until November 2021. This could be interpreted as a reduction in talking to a broader international audience during that time61,62,63, due to the fact that English is the most widely understood language on the internet by far31,64. However, not surprisingly, with the mobilization of the Russian troops along the Ukrainian border and specifically in the weeks leading up to the war, with a spike during outbreak, we observe a substantial shift towards English. We hypothesize users wanted to let the world know what was happening and called for aid31, which is supported by the fact that we observe a heavy spike in English tweets assigned to the first war topic (more related to help, support and updates). While we record a large influx of English speaking users during that time (+35% in number of tweets), we can also see a substantial behavioural shift (+130%). Already active users tweet substantially more in English, independent of the language they were normally tweeting in. As the war continues to unfold, this somewhat reverses, with some of the newly joined English users leaving and behaviour reverting, although not to pre-aggression levels. With the world being more aware of the situation, and the international community supporting Ukraine in various ways65,66, users likely have less reasons to continue tweeting in English. Instead, they return back to intra-national discussions and thus their native language(s).LimitationsWe recognize that while our study provides a strong foundation towards a better understanding on how the Ukrainian population reacted to the Russian invasion both on- and offline, possible limitations need to be acknowledged. The sample of users investigated here is not representative of the entire Ukrainian population. Indeed, it is skewed towards the younger and middle-aged part of the population (aged 18-49, see also Section \u201cUser Characteristics\u201d). Additionally, we want to emphasize that geo-information is not included on most Twitter clients by default, which might further skew the sample. As on most other social media platforms, users have the option to create new accounts, which we cannot match to their prior ones. Hence, some of the behavioural effects might even be underestimated and instead accounted for as sample effects. Moreover, users might stop tweeting (with Ukrainian geo-information) for various reasons (e.g. because they fled the country). One should keep in mind that the behavioural language shifts taking place with the outbreak of the war are only demonstrated for those users who continue to tweet at and/or after the outbreak, which could potentially lead to a selection bias. Future work may analyze the content and sentiment of the tweets more closely. This could be augmented through the use of media objects attached to the tweets such as images and videos. An investigation of retweet and follower networks may reveal additional differences between those users that are shifting language to those that are not. Naturally, any analysis can be repeated and extended to other social media platforms.ConclusionIn summary, our work investigated tweeting activity and language choice on Ukrainian Twitter before and during the Russian war in Ukraine through a large-scale longitudinal study. We demonstrate substantial shifts away from the Russian language to Ukrainian, which we interpret as users\u2019 conscious choice towards a more Ukrainian (online) identity. More than half of the predominately Russian-tweeting users shift towards Ukrainian, and a quarter of them even perform a hard-switch to Ukrainian, as the war breaks out. This can be seen as citizens\u2019 increasing opposition to Russia and a return to the country\u2019s linguistic roots as well as a push towards a conscious self-definition of being Ukrainian.Data availabilityData are available at the Open Science Framework (OSF) using https://osf.io/48sbc or with the https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/48SBC. As per Twitter developer agreement 18th April 2023, we are legally not allowed to share tweets beyond their IDs. Hence, we share our data in two ways. First, by sharing all tweet IDs needed to construct our aggregated datasets. Second, by sharing our aggregated datasets that are used for all our analyses. All of these are provided in the OSF repository with a corresponding documentation.Code availabilityAll of our code (including the aggregation scripts) is also available in the OSF repository at https://osf.io/48sbc or with the https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/48SBC. Descriptions for each script are provided there. We conducted our main analyses using R 4.1.3. In the OSF repository, we provide a session info file, which lists the version of every R package employed to conduct our analyses. We conducted the topic modelling using Python 3.10 and BERTopic 0.15.0.ReferencesSaroj, A. & Pal, S. Use of social media in crisis management: A survey. Int. J.

If found guilty, they face up to 12 years in prison.The investigation comes as Kyiv attempts to clamp down on corruption in a bid to speed up its membership in the European Union and NATO. Officials from both blocs have demanded widespread anti-graft reforms before Kyiv can join them.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected on an anti-corruption platform in 2019, long before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Both the president and his aides have portrayed the recent firings of top officials, notably that of Ivan Bakanov, former head of the State Security Service, in July 2022, as proof of their efforts to crack down on graft.

Ukrainian authorities said that 230 Ukrainian prisoners of war returned home in the first exchange in almost five months. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that 248 Russian servicemen have been freed under the deal sponsored by the United Arab Emirates.The UAE\u2019s Foreign Ministry attributed the successful swap to the \u201cstrong friendly relations between the UAE and both the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ukraine, which were supported by sustained calls at the highest levels.\u201d The UAE has maintained close economic ties with Moscow despite Western sanctions and pressure on Russia after it launched its invasion in 2022.

Some of the Ukrainians had been held since 2022. Among them were some of those who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine\u2019s Snake Island and the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.Russian officials offered no other details of the exchange.Also Wednesday, Russia said it shot down 12 missiles fired at one of its southern regions bordering Ukraine, as Kyiv\u2019s forces seek to embarrass the Kremlin and puncture President Vladimir Putin\u2019s argument that life is going on as normal despite the fighting.The situation in the border city of Belgorod, which came under two rounds of shelling on Wednesday morning, \u201cremains tense,\u201d said regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov, writing on Telegram. \u201cAir defense systems worked,\u201d he said, promising more details about possible damage after inspecting the area later in the day, part of a New Year\u2019s holiday week in Russia.Ukraine fired two Tochka-U missiles and seven rockets at the region late Tuesday, followed by six Tochka-U missiles and six Vilkha rockets on Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry said.The Soviet-built Tochka-U missile system has a range of up to 120 kilometers (75 miles) and a warhead that can carry cluster munitions. Ukraine has received some cluster munitions from the United States but the Tochka-U and Vilkha can use their own cluster munitions.The Russian side of the frontier has come under increasingly frequent attack in recent days. Throughout the war, border villages have sporadically been targeted by Ukrainian artillery fire, rockets, mortar shells and drones launched from thick forests where they are hard to detect.Lately, as Russia fired missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities, Kyiv\u2019s troops have aimed at Belgorod\u2019s regional capital, which is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city.Belgorod, with a population of about 340,000, is the biggest Russian city near the border. It can be reached by relatively simple and movable weapons such as multiple rocket launchers.On Saturday, shelling of Belgorod killed 25 people, including five children, in one of the deadliest strikes on Russian soil since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion. Another civilian was killed Tuesday in a new salvo.Hitting Belgorod and disrupting city life is a dramatic way for Ukraine to show it can strike back against Russia, whose military outnumbers and outguns Kyiv\u2019s forces.The tactic appeared to be having some success, with signs the attacks are unsettling the public, political leaders and military observers.On Monday, Putin lashed out against the Belgorod attacks by Ukraine. \u201cThey want to intimidate us and create uncertainty within our country,\u201d he said, promising to step up retaliation.Answering a question from a soldier who asked him about civilian casualties in Belgorod, Putin said: \u201cI also feel a simmering anger.\u201dMany Russian military bloggers have expressed regret about Moscow\u2019s withdrawal from the border area in September 2022 amid a swift counteroffensive by Kyiv, and they have argued that more territory must be seized to secure Belgorod and other border areas.Russia describes Ukrainians as \u201cterrorists\u201d who indiscriminately target residential areas while insisting Moscow only aims at depots, arms factories and other military facilities \u2014 even though there is ample evidence that Russia is hitting Ukrainian civilian targets.Ukrainian officials rarely acknowledge responsibility for strikes on Russian territory.In another Russian border region on Wednesday, the city of Zeleznogorsk was briefly cut off from the power grid after Ukrainian shelling, local officials said.Authorities were forced to temporarily shut down an electricity substation in the city of 100,000 people in the Kursk region to repair the damage from an aerial attack, Kursk Gov. Roman Starovoit said on Telegram.Residents were without power or heat, he said, although electricity was restored in most of the city about two hours later, he said.Russia has recently intensified its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, including using Kinzhal missiles which can fly at 10 times the speed of sound. The Kremlin\u2019s forces appear to be targeting Ukraine\u2019s defense industry, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Wednesday.The onslaught has prompted Kyiv officials to ask its Western allies to provide further air defense support.NATO announced Wednesday that it would help member nations buy up to 1,000 surface-to-air Patriot guided missiles in a deal possibly costing about $5.5 billion. That could allow alliance members to send more of their own defense systems to Ukraine.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

With some reports still pending verification, it said, the increase was likely higher.Danielle Bell who heads the U.N.\u2019s monitoring mission. said: \u201cCivilian casualties had been steadily decreasing in 2023 but the wave of attacks i n late December and early January violently interrupted that trend.\u201dThe U.N. mission said it is verifying reports the recent intense Russian missile and drone attacks that began hitting populated areas across Ukraine on Dec. 29 and continued into early January killed 86 civilians and injured 416 others.

On Jan. 4, it said, Russian missiles struck the small town of Pokrovsk and nearby village of Rivne close to the front lines, burying two families \u2013 six adults and five children \u2013 in the rubble of their homes. Some bodies have still not been found, it said.In another attack on Jan. 6, the blast wave from a Russian missile strike in Novomoskovsk injured 31 civilians including eight passengers on a minibus that was destroyed during the morning commute, the U.N. said.The confirmed number of civilians killed since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022 is more than 10,200, including 575 children, and the number of injured is over 19,300, the U.N. humanitarian office\u2019s operations director, Edem Wosornu, told the U.N. Security Council last Wednesday.Neither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each is at pains to amplify the other side\u2019s casualties as the nearly two-year war grinds on with no sign of peace talks to end the conflict.

Zelenskyy confirmed in an interview with Italian broadcaster RAI TV released late Sunday that he was thinking about removing Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the popular commander-in-chief of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. He said he was contemplating the move to ensure the country remains led by individuals who are \u201cconvinced of victory\u201d against Russia. \u201cA reset, a new beginning is necessary,\u201d Zelenskyy said. The review is \u201cnot about a single person but about the direction of the country\u2019s leadership.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thinking about this replacement, but you can\u2019t say here we replaced a single person,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cWhen we talk about this, I mean a replacement of a series of state leaders, not just in a single sector like the military. If we want to win, we must all push in the same direction, convinced of victory. We cannot be discouraged, let our arms fall. We must have the right positive energy.\u201d                    RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR                What\u2019s in the bipartisan Senate package to aid Ukraine, secure U.S. borderSenators release a border and Ukraine deal but the House speaker declares it \u2018dead on arrival\u2019Shelling kills at least 28 at bakery in Russian-occupied Ukraine, Moscow-installed officials sayZelenskyy\u2019s comments were his first acknowledgement of Zaluzhnyi,'s possible firing. The potential ouster of the general already has caused an uproar in Ukraine and delighted the Kremlin as the war approaches its second anniversary. Zaluzhnyi is widely respected among Ukrainian service members and considered a national hero. He is credited with stalling Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in the early days of the war and expertly pushing back Moscow\u2019s troops. Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko criticized the possibility of Zaluzhnyi\u2019s firing, saying it was due to the general\u2019s leadership that \u201cmany Ukrainians truly trust the armed forces.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy poses for a photo with servicemen during his visit to Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, Feb. 4, 2024. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awards serviceman during his visit to Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, Feb. 4, 2024. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)\u201cToday is a moment when politics might prevail over reason and country\u2019s interests,\u201d Klitschko said on social media. The mayor of Ukraine\u2019s capital city has been a vocal critic of Zelenskyy. The presidency in turn has accused Klitschko\u2019s office of inefficiencies. It is unclear who might replace Zaluzhnyi and if his successor would command the same level of respect from Ukraine\u2019s troops and foreign defense leaders. His firing could risk degrading morale at a critical time in the war.According to Ukrainian and Western media reports, Zelenskyy asked Zaluzhnyi to resign last week, but the general refused. Zaluzhnyi has not commented publicly on the reports. Tensions between him and the president have been rising since a much anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive, which was launched in June with the help of an array of Western weapons, failed to produce major territory gains in Russian-occupied areas, disappointing allies. Ukraine now is grappling with ammunition and personnel shortages while Russia is on the offensive, mounting relentless attacks. Four people were killed and at least one was injured in a Monday afternoon strike over the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine, the head of the local military administration said. The need for a broad mobilization to beef up the number of Ukrainian troops has reportedly been one of the areas of disagreement between Zelenskyy and Zaluzhnyi. Zelenskyy said at the end of last year that he had turned down the military\u2019s request to marshal up to 500,000 people, demanding more details about how the mobilization would be organized and paid for.A rift between Zaluzhnyi and Zelenskyy first broke into the open in the fall when the general acknowledged in an interview with The Economist that the fighting with Russia had stalemated. The president strongly denied that was the case. For his part, Zaluzhnyi has published two essays laying out his vision for how Ukraine can win the war. In his writings, he said it was critical for Ukraine to have air superiority, to extending its efficiency in countering enemy artillery, to build up reserves and to increase electronic warfare capabilities.Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren announced Monday that the Netherlands was preparing six additional F-16 fighter jets to give Ukraine on top of 18 the country previously pledged. Ukraine\u2019s \u201caerial superiority is essential for countering Russian aggression,\u201d Ollongren said in a message on X, formerly Twitter. Denmark also has promised to donate 19 F-16s to Ukraine. Lt. Gen. Serhii Nayev, the commander of the Ukrainian military\u2019s joint forces, said Monday that the country was set to receive missiles with a range of 300 to 500 kilometers (186 to 310 miles) along with the F-16s as part of upcoming defense aid packages from its allies, according to Ukrainian news agency RBK-Ukraine.Ukraine desperately needs more Western military assistance as Russian forces maneuver from many directions along the drawn-out war\u2019s 1,500-kilometer (900-mile) front line. House Republicans in the U.S. are moving forward with a military spending package that provides aid to Israel but leaves out more help for Ukraine. Zaluzhnyi\u2019s dismissal could fuel further uncertainty among Western allies.Russia has rejoiced at the prospect, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that the talk about Zaluzhnyi\u2019s dismissal exposed rifts in the Ukrainian leadership. The Ukrainska Pravda newspaper reported Monday that Zelenskyy also was considering the removal of General Staff Chief Serhii Shaptala.Zaluzhnyi on Monday congratulated Shaptala on his birthday and posted a picture of them together on Facebook.\u201cIt will still be very difficult for us, but we will definitely never be ashamed,\u201d Zaluzhnyi wrote.___Follow AP\u2019s Russia-Ukraine coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Now, as Ukraine heads into the third year of defending itself against Russia\u2019s aggression, the suggestion persists \u2013 but increasingly, it\u2019s the west that needs the off-ramp.Ukraine\u2019s prospects, after two years of a gruelling war that have taken an enormous human toll, are uncertain. Its population losses, both in terms of battlefield casualties and the flood of emigration that followed the invasion, will be difficult to remedy, and could have crippling consequences for Ukraine\u2019s already struggling economy. Not only that but the cost of the war is increasing at a staggering rate. The latest joint assessment by the EU, World Bank and UN of Ukraine\u2019s recovery needs puts these at US$486 billion (\u00a3385.6 billion), up $75 billion since last year. This means Ukraine\u2019s needs have grown in 12 months by one and a half times the total amount the EU has made available in support for Ukraine over the next four years. According to the annual index of risks for 2023 produced by the Munich Security Conference, a global forum for debating international security policy, Russia was perceived as the top risk by five of the G7 countries. In 2024, this perception is only shared by two G7 members. Given the absolutely critical dependence of Ukraine on G7 political, economic and military support, this is worrying. It does not bode well for the ability of Europe\u2019s political leaders to sustain the necessary public backing for continued aid transfers. Voters in France and Germany, for example, are significantly more concerned about mass migration and radical Islamic terrorism than Putin\u2019s designs for Ukraine. Moreover, Ukraine is not the only crisis demanding the attention of the collective west. The war in Gaza and wider conflagration across the Middle East is, and will remain, high on the agenda. But there are numerous other flashpoints that often fail to grab global news headlines. The ongoing civil war in Sudan, the intensifying conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and rising tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia all have the potential to feed directly into the fear of western publics about yet another mass migration crisis.Nuclear sabre rattling by North Korea, Iranian sponsorship of terrorist proxies across the Middle East, and the apparent consolidation of a new \u201caxis of evil\u201d between these two and Russia are unlikely to calm nerves in western capitals.Costly distractionAgainst this background, the war in Ukraine has become a major and increasingly costly distraction. Many leaders \u2013 in Europe in particular \u2013 are worried, perhaps disproportionately, about a return of Donald Trump to the White House and the possible end of a meaningful transatlantic alliance. If the US withdraws support, there is a fear that a continuation of the war in Ukraine could expose Europe even more to Russian aggression than is already the case.The key problem is that mere rhetorical commitments to supporting Ukraine are not just meaningless but counterproductive. They uphold the mirage of a winnable war without providing the required capabilities. As the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, told the Munich Security Conference on February 17, the military equipment shortages that Ukraine has experienced over the last several months were a key factor in the recent loss of the town of Avdiivka to Russian forces. The loss of the town of Avdiivka will not shift the frontlines of the war much, but is a huge blow to Ukrainian morale.Institute for the Study of WarThe frontline may not have shifted more than a few hundred metres as a result of this loss, but the psychological impact is significant \u2013 including in the west, where doubts over the will and ability to sustain Ukraine\u2019s efforts are on the rise again. If the conflict continues on its current trajectory \u2013 and even more so if the narrative of an unwinnable war gains more traction \u2013 western support is unlikely even to prevent Ukraine from losing badly, possibly leading to the kind of total defeat Putin imagined in his recent interview with Tucker Carlson.A Ukrainian defeat would be a dangerous humiliation for the west. In light of the continuing rhetoric about the west\u2019s \u201ciron-clad commitment\u201d to a just peace for Ukraine, a Russian victory would accelerate the decline of the current international order. It would usher in a drawn-out transition period to something far less favourable \u2013 and not just to western interests. A return to the bloc confrontation of the cold war \u2013 but with a probably stronger Chinese-led alliance with Russia, Iran and North Korea facing off against a weakening and less united western alliance \u2013 would leave little room to address problems such as climate change and food security. This should also be a warning to those in the global south who think they have little, if anything, at stake in Ukraine. Compromise solutionSearching for an off-ramp does not mean letting Putin win. It means enabling Ukraine to defend the areas currently still under its control. This will require more western aid, but also serious consideration of negotiating a ceasefire. An end to the fighting would buy western Europe and Ukraine time to build up stronger domestic defence capabilities. Ukraine has concluded bilateral security deals with the UK, France and Germany \u2013 and deals with other G7 members are likely to follow. These deals would provide more of a guarantee for Ukrainian democracy and sovereignty than the currently futile attempt to restore the country\u2019s territorial integrity in full \u2013 or its hopes for imminent Nato membership that are unlikely to be fulfilled. Reassessing current realities on the battlefield in this way will undoubtedly be seen as appeasement by some. But a more fitting analogy might be that of West Germany in 1949 and, even more so, of South Korea in 1953, both of which needed to establish internationally recognised borders in order to establish sovereignty in the face of hostile neighbouring powers. The challenge for Ukraine and its western partners is to establish the equivalent of the Korean peninsula\u2019s 38th parallel. The alternative, short of the west seriously doubling down on military support for Kyiv, is a slow and agonising defeat on the battlefield, with far-reaching consequences beyond Ukraine.NATORussiaVladimir PutinUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraine invasion 2022Give me perspectiveWant to write?

As he lifted two grenades in the air, a Ukrainian drone swept in from above and exploded.Soon, the smoke cleared, a surveillance drone overhead showed, revealing the Russian soldier\u2019s corpse. That day\u2019s attack, just north of the destroyed city of Avdiivka, was repelled. But the Ukrainians were under no illusions: There would be many more.\u201cThey come in waves,\u201d said Lt. Oleksandr Shyrshyn, 29, the deputy battalion commander in the 47th Mechanized Brigade. \u201cAnd they do not stop.\u201dAs the war enters its third year, Ukrainians find themselves outmanned and outgunned. After dominating the fighting in the first year and battling mostly to a standstill in the second, they have relinquished the momentum to Russia. Now they are digging in and fighting to hold on.Mortar crews need to ration artillery shells. Troops are being rotated from units in the rear to join undermanned infantry units at the front, and there are shortages of critical supplies needed to repair and maintain Ukraine\u2019s armored vehicles.ImageUkrainian soldiers next to a Russian tank outside Bakhmut, in territory where the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade counterattacked and regained control.ImageMonths of artillery battles outside Bakhmut have left fields riddled with craters.ImageA soldier with the 93rd Mechanized Brigade at a bunkered Ukrainian position outside Bakhmut.Because the Ukrainians are critically short of ammunition, for instance, they cannot afford to fire at only one or two advancing enemy soldiers, so the Russians have adapted and often move in small numbers to their most forward positions. They try to amass enough soldiers to storm a Ukrainian trench and overwhelm the defenders.\u201cNow, we don\u2019t have enough equipment, enough people to go on the offensive,\u201d Lieutenant Shyrshyn said. \u201cSo the main goal, for now, is to hold the position we have.\u201dKyiv recently announced the allocation of nearly $500 million to build fortifications along its border with Russia and to create a deeper defensive line in the eastern Donbas region that can serve as fallback positions should the Russians achieve a major breakthrough.The epicenter of the fighting remains around Avdiivka in the eastern Donetsk region, where the Russians have staged relentless assaults, no matter the obstacles. They spent weeks fighting for control of an industrial slag heap on the outskirts of the city, sending waves of troops up only to be cut down in horrifying fusillades. They creep through tunnels under the city streets and direct unmanned vehicles packed with explosives at Ukrainian positions.It is all in the pursuit of another annihilated city. But their attacks in Avdiivka and elsewhere along the front serve a larger goal: to seize the advantage at a time American military support to Ukraine has ceased, and to overwhelm the Ukrainians with sheer mass.ImageVuhledar, a ruined city and a key hot spot on the eastern front. ImageA civilian in his apartment in Vuhledar.ImageAbout 150 civilians remain in Vuhledar.While they are now almost exclusively engaged in defensive operations, Ukrainian soldiers interviewed along the front said that did not mean they could simply hunker down. They are seeking to inflict maximum pain on Russian forces while avoiding prolonged battles that could result in their own steep losses.For the moment, Russian forces are achieving only marginal gains despite pouring enormous amounts of resources into their winter offensive.Last month, journalists from The New York Times were able to watch several recent battles with commanders and drone operators around Avdiivka and another ruined city, Vuhledar \u2014 two key hot spots on the eastern front. The scope of the Russian losses was evident in the fields of ruined armor and the broken bodies of soldiers littering snow covered fields.The Ukrainians are using mines and other obstacles to channel Russian armor into kill zones, where they can be hit with heavy guns nearly every time they mount an armored assault. They are aggressively using Western-supplied fighting vehicles and tanks as hunter-killers when Russian troops get close to the Ukrainian positions.Since the Russians are now able to fire five times as many shells as the Ukrainians in some parts of the front, according to artillery units working on the front, the Ukrainians have had to increasingly turn to bomb-laden drones piloted remotely, known as FPVs, to try to plug the gap.ImageThe people who live in Vuhledar rely on occasional aid, delivered at significant risk by volunteers, to survive the winter.ImageVuhledar has come under greater pressure since the capture of another town, Marinka.ImageResidents in the city are without electricity, water or any city services to rely on.But the Ukrainian firepower is still limited. Major Serhii Bets, 30, the chief of staff of the 48th Separate Rifle Battalion of the 72nd Mechanized Brigade, said that the drones were an effective tool but could not be compared with the big guns.\u201cA first-person drone will not disassemble the dugout, will not mow the tree line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not exert such psychological pressure on the enemy. And we don\u2019t have a lot of FPV crews\u201dThe Russians also still dominate the skies and, after a brief pause following the downing of several Russian fighter jets, the aerial bombardments have resumed, soldiers said.Scores of giant craters left by 1,000-pound bombs in annihilated villages testify to the destructive force that Russia continues to bring to bear.While it is unclear how long Kyiv can sustain its defense if its Western allies do not continue to provide robust military support, Ukrainian forces continue to inflict heavy damage on Russian forces while mostly holding the line.Since Russia began renewed offensive operations in October, it has lost 365 main battle tanks and some 700 armored vehicles, \u201cbut only achieved minor territorial gains,\u201d the British military intelligence agency said last Monday.More than 13,000 Russian soldiers were killed and wounded in only two months of operations aimed at capturing Avdiivka, according to a declassified American intelligence assessment released in December. That works out to about 3,000 Russian casualties for every square mile of territorial gains.ImageAs the war enters its third year, Ukrainians find themselves outmanned and outgunned.ImageAfter dominating the fighting in the first year of the war and battling mostly to a standstill in the second, the Ukrainians have relinquished the momentum to Russia.ImageUkrainian soldiers with the 72nd Mechanized Brigade refitting at a frontline position in a building in Vuhledar.Still, the British intelligence agency warned that Russia would most likely be able to \u201ccontinue this level of offensive activity for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u201cIf the Russians are interested in a particular section of the front, they will raze it to the ground,\u201d said Major Bets of the rifle battalion, pointing to a screen showing live drone footage to illustrate his point.\u201cSince mid-December, the Russians have completely destroyed this tree line,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look around the tree line in a radius of 100 by 100, there is just plowed land.\u201d But, he said, Ukrainian defenders are \u201cdigging holes to live somehow, holding on.\u201dStill, even small Russian gains pose risks for Ukraine. The capture of Marinka \u2014 a town near Avdiivka outside the city of Donetsk \u2014 after years of fighting has allowed the Russians to open up a new line of attack on another town, Vuhledar, from the north.\u201cThe enemy has partially succeeded,\u201d Major Bets said. \u201cWe will not hide it.\u201dThey use their advantage in artillery to \u201cdisorient our guys in the trenches, and then the infantry comes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are fighting against the infantry calmly and holding our ground.\u201d\u201dIt is no secret that the Kremlin\u2019s strategy is to outlast the Ukrainians, and its forces are keenly aware of Ukrainian artillery shortages, soldiers said, repeatedly adjusting tactics to try to gain an advantage.As cannon fire thundered above ground last week in Avdiivka, more than 150 Russians crept through a narrow pipe underground to an important Ukrainian fortified position in a recreational facility called \u201cThe Tsar\u2019s Hut.\u201dImageA woman who collected wood pieces from a tree that was bombed in Vuhledar, with her dog. ImageAs supplies and ammunition dwindle, Ukrainians said they would have to pay a higher price in blood to simply hold their lines.ImageFor the moment, Russian forces are achieving only marginal gains despite pouring enormous amounts of resources into their winter offensive.They emerged behind the Ukrainians and ambushed them, according to both sides. At a campaign event on Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin, who is running for re-election, appeared to cite the operation as evidence of success on the battlefield, saying Russian soldiers \u201cseized 19 houses and are holding them.\u201dAs supplies and ammunition dwindle, Ukrainians said they would have to pay a higher price in blood to simply hold their lines.Lt. Serhii Stetsenko, 40, a commander of an assault platoon, said that even if the Russians only manage to claw their way forward a few feet, they dig in and fortify.They will often leave only two or three soldiers at these new forward positions. \u201cThey call them camels,\u201d he said, using a slang term for people who do tedious work while being treated like animals.Those soldiers can spend several days digging, while another group assembles before starting another storming operation, he said.Sgt. Danylo, the commander of an air reconnaissance unit for the 47th who asked that his surname not be used for security reasons, said that if the defense is working well, they will break up an attack before it can get fully underway.\u201cDefensive operations are much more controlled,\u201d Sergeant Danylo said during an interview at an outpost near Avdiivka. \u201cYou are setting the conditions for the ground you control.\u201dBut in battle, things can quickly spiral out of control.Lt. Stetsenko described one recent clash when a Russian tank managed to make it to their position.\u201cThe tank destroys everything in its path, so you won\u2019t even stick your head out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey jump out of the vehicles and rush into the trenches, destroying everything in front of them. Guys who surrendered, they shot them all.\u201dMajor Bets likened the confrontations to a boxing match. \u201cThe main thing is the ability to take a punch,\u201d he said. \u201cI can proudly tell the whole world that Ukraine knows how to take a punch. But this is not the last round.\u201dImageOutside Bakhmut last month.Liubov Sholudko and Anastasia Kuznietsova contributed reporting.Marc Santora has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia.\u00a0He was previously based in London as an international news editor focused on breaking news events and earlier the bureau chief for East and Central Europe, based in Warsaw.

So Here Are Mine For 2024By Michael Peck January 24, 2024Here\u2019s a guaranteed way to lose money: bet on  the future of the Ukraine war. Others have made the same bet, and they lost big time. Remember those confident predictions by experts that Russia would take Kyiv in a week? Two years later, that Russia can barely hang on to Crimea.\u00a0\u00a0Or that Europe would sacrifice Ukraine in return for cheap Russian energy? Tell that to Russian troops being blasted by British missiles and German tanks. Those fancy Western weapons would enable Ukraine\u2019s summer 2023 counteroffensive to liberate Crimea and drive Putin\u2019s legions back into Russia? A glance at a map will tell you how well that went.\u00a0So in that spirit, this writer offers of a few predictions of his own. It\u2019s a win-win proposition: being right will be proof of sagacity and foresight. And being wrong can\u2019t be any more wrong than most everyone else has been.\u00a0\u00a0Prediction 1: The War Will Continue.Putin has invested his political life \u2014 and possibly his physical wellbeing \u2014 on doing to Kyiv what the Red Army did to Berlin. Ukraine is tired and wants peace, but Ukrainians need something positive to show for their efforts, such as liberating Crimea, rather than dying simply to stave off a predatory megalomaniac in the Kremlin.\u00a0\u00a0Barring some decisive battlefield event, it\u2019s hard to imagine a negotiated peace that both sides will accept at this point. This war will eventually end, as all wars do. But not in 2024.\u00a0Prediction 2: The Stalemate Will Continue.\u00a0\u00a0The more that Ukraine and Russia have striven for victory, the greater the stalemate. This is partly due to structural defects in both armies, such as poor tactics and lack of resources.\u00a0\u00a0And because of the diffusion of technologies such as drones and GPS-guided munitions that make movement in the open risky and encourage troops to hunker down. Either way, the result is likely to be continued trench warfare and costly battles fought over little-known villages.\u00a0Get the LatestSign up to receive regular emails and stay informed about CEPA's work.Email  \u0394Prediction 3: There Will Be More Disappointing Wonder Weapons.\u00a0\u00a0Can you guess what 2024\u2019s Wonder Weapon of the Year will be? Previous contestants have included drones, HIMARS rockets, hypersonic missiles, and even old Leopard tanks and Bradley troop carriers. How well they have transformed the war can be seen in Prediction 2 (\u201cstalemate\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The frontrunner for this year is probably Artificial Intelligence, which promises to make smart bombs smarter and the targeting process for them faster. Judging by history, either Ukraine or Russia \u2013 more likely Ukraine, with Western help \u2013 will reap a brief AI advantage until the other side either copies the technology or learns to nullify it.\u00a0Prediction 4: The US and Europe Will Continue to Support Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0The rise of far-right parties in Europe, and the possible reelection of Donald Trump, can only worry Kyiv. But for democratic countries, betraying allies leaves a bad taste: witness how Chamberlain went down in history after Munich, or how Americans politics was roiled over who lost Nationalist China, South Vietnam and Afghanistan.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s easy for some right-wing leaders to denounce aiding Ukraine \u2014 as long they\u2019re not the party in power. Stick them with the responsibility for handing Ukraine over to Putin, and they may sing a different tune.\u00a0Prediction 5: The World\u2019s Attention Will Shift to Another Conflict.\u00a0\u00a0This has already happened, as media coverage of the Gaza war has drowned out the once-gushing stream of news about Ukraine.\u00a0\u00a0In turn, the focus on Gaza may shift to potential conflicts between Israel and Iran, Iran and America, and China, Taiwan and America. But it\u2019s just as likely that an unexpected conflict will arise somewhere else to draw world attention.\u00a0\u00a0Something will happen somewhere. You can bet money on that.\u00a0Michael Peck is a defense commentator.

We will intensify strikes. Not a single crime against our civilian population will go unpunished,\u201d the Russian leader said, describing the barrage of Belgorod as a \u201cterrorist act.\u201dRussia has blamed Ukraine for Saturday\u2019s attack, which was one of the deadliest to take place on Russian soil since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine started more than 22 months ago. Russian officials said the death toll stood at 25 as of Monday, including five children.

Putin accused Western nations of using Ukraine to try and \u201cput Russia in its place.\u201d While vowing retribution, he insisted Russia would only target military infrastructure in Ukraine. \u201cOf course, we can hit public squares in Kyiv and in any other Ukrainian city,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand \u2014 I\u2019m boiling with rage \u2014 but do we need to hit civilians? No. We are hitting military targets, and that\u2019s what we will keep doing.\u201dBoth Ukraine and Russia have relied extensively on explosive droves during the war. The wave of Russian attacks in Ukraine continued throughout the day Monday. A 15-year-old boy was killed and seven people wounded after falling debris from one of 87 downed drones hit a residential building in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, the head of the region\u2019s military administration, Oleh Kiper, said. Debris also sparked a number of small fires, including at the city\u2019s port.Drone strikes and artillery fire also killed three people in Ukraine\u2019s Kherson, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, including a 73-year-old woman.In the western city of Lviv, Russian attacks severely damaged a museum dedicated to Roman Shukhevych, a controversial Ukrainian nationalist and military commander who fought for Ukrainian independence during World War II. University buildings in the town of Dubliany were also damaged, although no casualties were reported.Writing on social media, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi described the strike as \u201ca war for our history\u201d that was \u201csymbolic and cynical.\u201d Meanwhile, four people were killed and 13 more wounded following Ukrainian shelling on Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk, according to the region\u2019s Kremlin-installed leader, Denis Pushilin. Russian state media reported that a journalist was among the victims, but provided no further details.One person was also killed and another wounded in shelling on the Russian border town of Shebekino, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. ___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Of course, violence was always lurking with the wars that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia and jihadist terrorism. These threats, however, could be easily dealt with \u2014 thanks to the support of the United States \u2014 without major budgetary difficulty. Across the continent, the resources dedicated to defense fell by almost a third compared with Cold War levels, to less than 2% of GDP almost everywhere.At the dawn of the new millennium, war had become something that only happened to others: Somalians, Afghans, Iraqis, Congolese, Syrians. Europeans were involved, or not, in these distant conflicts in which the victims numbered in the hundreds of thousands. By choice, not obligation.At the time, Europeans \u2014 the French especially \u2014 were gladly discussing common defense, battle groups and, more recently, strategic autonomy. To paraphrase the Abb\u00e9 de l\u2019Attaignant\u2019s poem, we were happy to talk about it \u2014 albeit less gracefully \u2014 without giving it substance. Not a single one of the battle groups created to much fanfare in 2006 ever saw the battlefield. Our coalition wars were generally led by the Americans or carried out within the NATO framework in the Persian Gulf, in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya, or against the Islamic State. Why should we step away from this platonic arrangement when the Americans were always there just in case? Moreover, just mentioning it was enough to raise the specter of an American withdrawal: this was evident in the horror of Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State under Clinton, when the Europeans voiced claims that, in her eyes, could lead to thorny overlaps of strategic functions and result in unacceptable discrimination to the detriment of the United States.At the dawn of the new millennium, war had become something that only happened to others.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgThis Europe of grand pronouncements and little result is the world of yesterday. It should have ended at the latest in 2014 following the invasion and annexation of Crimea, a power play that threw into question the very foundations of the European security order established after the Second World War. At the time, Russia was not in a position to militarily counter a Western reaction that went beyond economic sanctions, the limits of which we were well aware. Prompt and substantial military aid to Ukraine may have dissuaded Russia from further pressing its advantage. Additionally, although we could for a time believe in the longevity of good strategic weather, storm clouds were building as early as 2007 in the wake of Putin\u2019s revisionist speech in Munich. The more clear-sighted among us were troubled by this, but without any notable tangible effects.It would take the attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 for the changing era to fully emerge in all its brutality. The \u201ctrente paresseuses\u201d of the post-Cold War era were well and truly over.The war\u2019s three dimensionsThe clash of arms that erupted on February 24, 2022 naturally focused on the Ukrainian dimension of Europe\u2019s first war between states this century. As early as July 2021, President Putin had laid out his detailed vision of the \u201chistorical unity of Russians and Ukrainians\u201d, which he reiterated in a lengthy televised address on the eve of the invasion. In this manifesto there is no place for either a Ukrainian nation or state. It is this pursuit of ultimate war that continues to underpin the objectives of Russian operations: \u201cdenazification\u201d (the fall of the democratic Ukrainian government led by a broadly elected Russian-speaking Jew); demilitarization (no Ukrainian army); neutralization (no membership to either the European Union or NATO); recognition prior to any discussion of the annexation of one-fifth of Ukrainian territory (including, therefore, the as yet unconquered areas of the Kherson, Zaporijia and Donbass regions).On February 24, 2022, the \u201ctrente paresseuses\u201d of the post-Cold War era were well and truly over.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgA Russian victory on this basis, with the absorption and subjugation of a country like Ukraine, would in itself alter the strategic and military balance in Europe, not to mention the effects of the likely exodus of a large portion of Ukraine\u2019s 40 million inhabitants to the Union. The invasion and annexation of sovereign states would once again become the practice it used to be throughout Europe prior to 1945.Of course, even if victorious, Russia will at first emerge weakened by a war that will have caused massive losses, with up to 100,000 killed, and thousands of tanks. But, during the Crimean War (1853-1856), Napoleon III\u2019s France, with its modest population of 30 million, suffered comparable losses (95,000 dead). It nevertheless recovered quickly, delivering victory in Italy as soon as 1859, during which France annexed Savoy and the county of Nice. The same could be true of the vast country of Russia with its largely untouched oil and gas revenues, and its 140 million inhabitants which will also be able to recover.In Moscow\u2019s view, the war clearly goes beyond the Ukrainian objective. The clash of arms managed to overshadow President Putin\u2019s diplomatic statement of objectives for all of Europe in December 2021, ten weeks before the invasion began. At that time, Russian diplomacy presented the United States and NATO \u2014 but not the EU or its member states \u2014 with two so-called security treaties. These texts, presented as take-it-or-leave-it ultimatums, stipulated that NATO could not come to the aid of the 11 member states that had joined the organization after the collapse of the USSR in 1991; in other words, Europe would be set back thirty years in strategic terms. Moreover, no new states would be eligible to join the Atlantic Alliance; as a result, Finland and Sweden \u2014 among others \u2014 would lose their sovereignty in terms of security and defense policy. This Russian demand was unanimously opposed even before the start of the war. Statements made by the Russian and French presidents during their last meeting in Moscow on February 7, 2022, began with this subject, which dominated their discussions.These objectives have not been abandoned. If Russia is victorious in Ukraine, despite all the support provided by the West, it is sure to be back with a vengeance once the wounds of war have been healed in two or three years\u2019 time.Finally, and here too, events precede the start of the invasion, and Russia is bringing a global dimension to its undertaking. On February 4, 2022, coinciding with the Winter Olympics in Beijing, Presidents Xi and Putin made a joint declaration of \u201cno-limits friendship\u201d between their two countries. Although subsequent events have shown that there are indeed some limits to this friendship, this partnership is of great strategic and diplomatic importance: Russia provides China with considerable depth in terms of energy and agriculture, and China compensates for the shortcomings of the Russian economy. The two countries support each other at the UN and cooperate militarily in the Pacific \u2014 the world\u2019s most important zone in strategic and economic terms.In each of these dimensions, European interests are, to varying degrees, at stake. Like the Russians and, to a certain extent, Biden\u2019s United States, Europeans must operate in a more or less integrated way in these three dimensions.Good news, bad news, very bad newsFrom the very first hours, and for the first eighteen months of the war, there was a prevailing sense of surprise. Surprise, except in Moscow and Washington, that the invasion had even happened. But also surprise, except perhaps in Kiev, that the invasion was immediately met with fierce and effective resistance, while Moscow expected the Ukrainian government and its capital to fall within the first four days of the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d. Such a rapid outcome would have rendered Western military support irrelevant. Finally, everyone, starting with the Europeans themselves, was surprised by the unity of Europe, particularly Germany, which proclaimed the Zeitenwende, the changing of an era: it gradually rose to become the leading European arms donor to Ukraine, with 7 billion euros planned in 2024. The key point here is that, in 2022, France lost the opportunity to lead Europe in the face of the Russian invasion: Emmanuel Macron had spent too much time in his vain attempt to win over a Putin impervious to the charms of \u201cat the same time\u201d (\u00aben m\u00eame temps\u00bb).From the very first hours, and for the first eighteen months of the war, there was a prevailing sense of surprise.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgIn fact, the Union immediately decided on and implemented major sanctions. These sanctions notably had the unexpected effect of virtually eliminating Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas. A European fund to finance military aid was set up, while European states played an active part in the \u201cRamstein Group\u201d, which brought together, under the leadership of the United States, some fifty countries around the world in support of the Ukrainian war effort. Over two years of war, European military aid \u2014 including from the United Kingdom and Norway \u2014 achieved parity with that provided by the United States, an unexpected result. Finally, Moscow was surprised that the Americans did not sacrifice their commitment in Ukraine on the altar of their strategic priority in the Indo-Pacific; on the contrary, the Biden administration saw a defeat in Ukraine as undermining the credibility of the United States in the face of China.And so, less than a year after the start of the war, the Ukrainians had recovered half of the territory captured by Russia since February 24th and liberated Kherson, the only regional capital to have fallen. Over the course of 2023, Ukraine managed to limit the initially devastating effects of Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian cities and infrastructure \u2014 particularly the electrical grid \u2014 and to break the Russian naval blockade of the Black Sea. This last point is crucial, given the Ukrainian economy\u2019s dependence on agri-food exports, and the importance of these exports to a number of countries in the South that import Ukrainian grain.Russia\u2019s powerful air force and Black Sea fleet faltered against a Ukraine whose navy is anecdotal and whose air force is numerically weak.Within twenty-two months, European military aid \u2014 including from the United Kingdom and Norway \u2014 achieved parity with that provided by the United States.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgOn the diplomatic front, and despite all the talk about the \u201cGlobal South\u201d, more than two-thirds of countries voted repeatedly against Russia at the UN General Assembly, while barely a quarter abstained and fewer than ten voted in support. These pleasant surprises concealed some less sunny realities, which are now coming to light. While Ukraine is resisting, it is not winning: more than one-sixth of its territory is currently occupied, fortified, annexed and being progressively Russified. In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s ground counter-offensive to sever the territorial continuity between Russia and Russian-occupied southern Ukraine failed. Successfully defending oneself, as the Ukrainians did in 2023, and recovering territory now deeply held by the invaders, are two different things. Although Russia\u2019s invasion plan certainly failed in its primary military objective, the invader managed to occupy the Ukrainian south within three days, from the edge of Mykola\u00efv to the outskirts of Mariupol.Despite its losses, Russia has learned not to disregard Ukrainian resistance and has adapted its tactics accordingly: effective mine and fortification warfare, successfully learning drone combat, and a certain superiority in terms of electronic warfare. Russia is also adding to its strengths, notably with the arrival of weapons from Iran and North Korea. Despite the Wagner militia\u2019s mutiny in June 2023 and Western sanctions, Putin\u2019s power shows no signs of economic, social or political collapse.The White House, which is often imitated by the Europeans, reacted slowly and hesitantly, even preventing the shipment of crucial military equipment to the battlefield, due to excessive fear of Russian reactions. It took sixteen months for the first Western heavy tanks to arrive. Twenty-three months after the start of the invasion, not a single Western-made combat aircraft had reached Ukraine. Neither the United States, except to a very limited extent, nor Germany, which has nearly 600 Taurus models, have delivered cruise missiles capable of striking the Russian military. Only the UK and France broke free of these restrictions by delivering Franco-British SCALP-Storm Shadow cruise missiles beginning in the summer of 2023; these missiles played a major role in the fight against the Russian fleet in the Black Sea and the Russian presence in Crimea, helping to break the blockade. Contrary to the fears expressed in Berlin and Washington, this did not lead to an unchecked escalation of the war. In the view of Germany and the United States, Ukraine should be able to restore its territorial integrity by withstanding the Russian assault, but without being able to respond deeply into the enemy\u2019s territory.Today, Ukraine is resisting, but not winning: more than one-sixth of its territory is currently occupied, fortified, annexed, and being progressively Russified.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgThe \u201ctrente paresseuses\u201d are being paid for today in Ukraine at a high cost. With the exception of South Korea vis-\u00e0-vis its terrifying neighbor to the north, no Western nation \u2014 not even the United States \u2014 has retained either the military-industrial capacity or the stockpiles of weapons and ammunition needed to rapidly wage a modern war between two major states. Washington had to source shells from South Korea and obtain ammunition from Japan for the Patriot missiles required for Ukraine\u2019s anti-missile defense.On the European side, things were no better; in the course of twenty-two months of war, the Union as a whole was able to deliver around 300,000 155 mm shells, enough for Ukraine to fight its war for twelve weeks. This was four times less than American shipments before they fell to zero in January 2024. France is now producing 2,000 \u201cfull rounds\u201d per month and plans to increase this to 3,000: enough to keep Ukraine at war for half a day, at the rate it has been waged for the first 20 months. However, Ukraine does not, or not yet, have the necessary factories on its soil to produce heavy artillery shells. The EU has now set a production target of 1.3 to 1.4 million shells a year by the end of 2024, a figure close to the US plan of 1.2 million by 2025. In the meantime, Ukraine currently needs more than 3.5 million shells per year, before the still uncertain promises made for 2025 are realized. Once the British and French reach their limits in terms of SCALP missile supply, and before their production possibly resumes, the Ukrainians will be left to face their losses alone, while Germany withholds its Taurus missiles, and the United States has parsimoniously supplied rare ATACMS missiles.The European Union as a whole was able to deliver around 300,000 155 mm shells, enough for Ukraine to fight its war for twelve weeks.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgThat\u2019s not the worst of it. We are now facing the prospect of American disengagement. This first manifested with the refusal of Congress to approve appropriations for the 2024 year. The immediate effect was the rationing of shells on the front line, with the daily consumption of shells falling from 8,000 to 2,000 in January. Today, four to five Russian heavy artillery shells are fired for every Ukrainian one. American anti-missile systems \u2014 Patriot, NASAM \u2014 are in short supply, with interception rates dropping from 80% to 40% against Russian cruise missiles, and to almost zero against hypersonic \u201cKinjal\u201d and other \u201cIskander\u201d missiles.This somewhat abstract accounting translates into very real destruction. Today, European defense resources are unable to make up for this shortfall: only one French-Italian \u201cMamba\u201d anti-missile system has been deployed in Ukraine.At the time of writing, the U.S. Congress, in the midst of its pre-election tug-of-war, has still not voted on appropriations for 2024. Congressional isolationism over the past few months has certainly been fueled by a polarized pre-election environment unlike anything seen since the years leading up to the Civil War. But it is by no means clear that this polarization will disappear, while American impatience with a Europe judged incapable of taking \u201cits\u201d war into its own hands is widely shared. This is also fueled by the only major issue which currently enjoys bipartisan political consensus in the United States, namely the desire to counter China\u2019s power. In view of the difficulties the United States is now having in fueling its war machine in the face of existing wars (Ukraine, Gaza) and potential wars (Taiwan), Europeans have been warned: the war in Ukraine will increasingly be their war.The European Union has so far managed to deal with its own financial problems. The 50 billion euro package initially planned for the years 2024-2027 was able to be approved despite Hungary\u2019s initial anti-Ukrainian veto. This aid is vital for preserving the stability of Ukrainian public finances, which underpins the Ukrainian war effort. For the moment, however, it has little impact on direct military aid, which remains largely a matter for individual countries.In the case of the USA and Europe, the confiscation of Russian central bank assets frozen in Western countries would solve the financial problem, with sums totaling around $300 billion. In practice, however, this would require the agreement of the G7 countries \u2014 Japan, the USA, Canada, France, Germany, the UK and Italy \u2014 as well as the EU itself. The advantage, but perhaps also the drawback, of this approach is that it avoids the need for agreement by the US Congress. It would be a technocratic solution to a political problem. This would set a major precedent and could weaken the international financial system. Even when tensions with Iraq and Iran were at their highest, funds frozen by foreign sanctions were not confiscated.Last but not least weighs the potential re-election of a Donald Trump who is running to win and preparing for his enthronement, whereas in 2016 he didn\u2019t think he would win and hadn\u2019t organized accordingly. He would be back in charge with both the will and the means to implement his anti-European, anti-NATO, Putin-aligned agenda. If his recent comments on settling Ukraine \u201cwithin 24 hours\u201d, or that Europe should not count too much on the United States, or his \u201cinvitation\u201d to Russia to attack countries in arrears on payments to Washington are anything to go by, Hurricane \u201cDonald\u201d would be swift, brutal and radical. At best, the United States would, like Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, become a dormant partner of NATO and at worst, a strategic partner with Russia, which it would try to pull away from its strategic partnership with China at the expense of concessions made at the expense of a scorned Europe.Even when tensions with Iraq and Iran were at their highest, funds frozen by foreign sanctions were not confiscated.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgThere\u2019s nothing fanciful about this view. In 2019, at the Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on, in the presence of Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron called for bringing Europe and Russia closer together in order to liberate it from China\u2019s embrace. In 2020, he reiterated this grand vision at the Munich Security Conference, France having organized a strategic dialogue with Russia that was, by all accounts, completely sterile. If the French could have dreamt of such a reversal of alliances, why wouldn\u2019t a re-elected Trump, knowing that he would have even greater motives and far more means? Why not \u201cTrump in Moscow\u201d just as there was once \u201cNixon in Beijing\u201d?It is worth noting in passing that a scenario in which the United States descends into political and constitutional turmoil would be no less damaging. This could be the case if the election\u2019s outcome was not accepted by a large part of the electorate and institutions, including an increasingly controversial Supreme Court.Doing away with \u201cbonsai armies\u201dGiven these conditions, Europeans must follow a few fundamental principles in taking concrete steps for 2024 and beyond. First, the worst-case scenario is sufficiently likely to over-determine the actions we take. On one side, this includes Trump\u2019s victory, with the impacts mentioned above; on another, Putin\u2019s refusal to enter into negotiations that are in line with Ukraine\u2019s vital interests; and finally, Beijing\u2019s continued close China-Russian partnership with its Asian neighbors and the collective West. To this we could add the predicted rise in power of populist parties in the June 2024 European elections, though this does not mean a change in power within the EU Member States, which remain the main source of security and defense policy, directly and indirectly via the European Council.Should one or more of these scenarios prove false, the initiatives suggested here in the name of the worst-case scenario would still be valid: he who can do more, can do less.The worst-case scenario is sufficiently likely to over-determine the actions we take.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgAnother principle, already endorsed by Europeans but which is sometimes forgotten, is that Ukraine is the best judge of its interests and of the strategy devised to defend them. Our aid policy must therefore be determined accordingly. As stated by President Zelensky, this strategy involves the military isolation of Crimea, considered to be the war\u2019s center of gravity. Indeed, imposing such a threat to the control of Crimea is probably the best lever available to bring Russia to the negotiating table under conditions consistent with Ukraine\u2019s vital interests. The delivery of French and British cruise missiles is consistent with Kiev\u2019s choices. Conversely, failure to deliver German Taurus\u2019 or American equivalents is not.This principle assumes, however, that there is still strong coherence between Ukraine\u2019s war aims and those of its European partners. Territorial integrity, political sovereignty, security and defense guarantees, and eventual membership to the Union are currently shared objectives, as demonstrated by the fact that no European state has recognized Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, to cite an example sometimes presented as a source of disagreement. This does not mean, and Ukraine agrees, today as in 2014, that a cessation of hostilities is contingent on the prior and simultaneous success of these objectives. Just as in Germany during the Cold War and in Cyprus after it, situations of unconsented division and illegal occupation remain unresolved \u2014 provided, at least, that political and security aspects are guaranteed: West Germany joined NATO 45 years before reunification, and Cyprus joined the EU in 2004.In any case, our European allies must not forget that any outcome of the conflict which might be perceived and presented by Moscow as a defeat for Ukraine would have fundamental strategic consequences for the European Union and European members of NATO. This scenario, combined with the withdrawal of an increasingly disengaged America, makes the question of extending France\u2019s nuclear guarantee to its European allies an immediate one. The latter now have every reason to enter into the nuclear dialogue proposed by France, notably by President Macron in 2020, and again in Stockholm recently.There\u2019s another, empirical, principle to consider: the war of invasion will soon be entering its third year. All current and planned measures must be consistent with long-term warfare. This applies in particular to all aspects of our defense industry\u2019s organization. As a corollary to this principle, any immediate measures must be taken keeping in mind the medium-term outlook. For example, to help Ukraine improve its military situation, our countries will be able to draw more heavily on our national stocks of weapons and ammunition as soon as we decide to increase our production rates. This reasoning can also be used in reverse: the stronger and sooner Ukraine\u2019s military success, the less we\u2019ll have to draw on our stocks in the long term. However, the window of opportunity will close as soon as Russian forces are no longer \u201cpinned down\u201d in Ukraine.This last assertion cannot be proven, but like their Soviet predecessors, Russian leaders pay close attention to the analysis of the balance of power. The immediate effort is naturally to maintain European and national financial and military flows. This is all the more understandable given that, contrary to popular belief, \u201cwar fatigue\u201d is largely absent from European opinion: at the end of 2023, continuing the policy of aid to Ukraine remains supported by more than 50% of those surveyed in 18 of the 26 EU member states. In the other eight \u2014 Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Greece \u2014 where support falls short of the 50% mark, there are relative majorities, and often governments (Italy, Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic in particular) that have clearly sided with Ukraine, supporting it militarily.The current and potential future failure of the United States also requires us to improve the quality of our efforts.It is also not impossible to leverage each individual nation\u2019s political influence. Do Germany\u2019s most motivated partners have as much influence as they could on the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles? Could France not convince Greece to agree to postpone the delivery of the SCALP missiles Athens has commissioned from us to benefit the Ukraine? After all, this is how Caesar cannons ordered by Denmark were able to be transferred to Ukraine.In the medium term, Europe \u2014\u00a0the Union and European NATO members alike\u00a0\u2014 must make the decisions required to face a Trumpian world. In budgetary terms, this means increasing the target of 2% of GDP allocated to defense by 2025, a decision made by NATO member countries following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Between now and 2030, this target should be 3%, a period of six years representing the equivalent of a military planning law, in line with industrial and organizational lead times. The annual budgetary effort at the EU level would be about 150 billion euros. If industry is up to the task, this would be enough to replace an end to American aid to Ukraine, and to begin the possible acquisition by European allies of so-called \u201ccornerstone\u201d military capabilities that the Americans could fully or partially withdraw from Europe: strategic intelligence capabilities, particularly space-based; anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense capabilities and the destruction of Russian anti-aircraft assets; command and control structures, etc.The sum may seem considerable, but Poland and Estonia have already increased their military budgets to 3% of GDP, as has Greece, which is facing Turkey. This was also the level of effort made by our partners during the Cold War, to say nothing of France, which was spending 5% to 6% of its GDP on the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d that was the Algerian War. For France, 3% is most likely the price it will have to pay to move the strategic autonomy it values from words to reality.Some have suggested that the Union could create a European defense fund, with Thierry Breton suggesting a total of 100 billion euros over a specified period. In Davos, Emmanuel Macron proposed that the Union issue bonds dedicated to defense. Why not? But any new European loan or corresponding increase in the Union\u2019s budget, established by treaty, is likely to be more difficult to sell politically than setting objectives that each nation meets in its own way \u2014 as was the case during the Cold War. What\u2019s more, the Union\u2019s financial framework would make it impossible to involve the UK, which, along with France, has the most experienced army and the widest range of skills among Europe\u2019s allies. This money, whether European or national, will only be successfully raised and spent if there is a major and difficult change in the way our armed forces acquire weapons and munitions. At present, each of our countries produces equipment on a very small scale: France has 220 Leclerc tanks and at one time exported just over 400, but does not have a tank production line. In the space of two years, Ukraine alone has destroyed or captured over 3,000 Russian tanks, more than 500 of which have been recycled in its own armed forces. The situation regarding shells has already been mentioned. In order to progress to large-scale production, it is not sufficient to urge manufacturers to produce by brandishing budget \u201cblueprints\u201d full of promises. Put another way, when it comes to armaments, we cannot go from small-scale to mass production by saying \u201cdo exactly what you did yesterday, but produce more\u201d.This transformation presupposes several non-financial initiatives in Europe, at both the national and EU levels, in areas that are within the purview of each decision-making level.Firstly, special procedures will have to be set up to accelerate the awarding of contracts. The model here is the American Defense Production Act developed during the Korean War. It was this DPA that Trump deployed during the Covid pandemic, offering $22 billion to laboratories and manufacturers to develop the vaccine within a given timeframe. This resulted in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine just in time: the lives saved were worth far more than the 22 billion dollars spent. This is a challenge that Europeans at the Community level, as well as in each Member State, have every reason to tackle, particularly in a country like France, where the budgetary decision-making process has become extraordinarily cumbersome.In terms of armaments, we cannot easily go from small-scale to mass production.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgWe need to reconsider the responsibilities of Brussels, in particular with regard to the possibility of purchasing armaments for the Union as a whole, and those of national capitals, which remain largely sovereign in this matter. These acquisitions can be made either individually, as in the case of the French Rafale jet, or through multinational cooperation, as in the case of the Italian-German-Hispanic-British Eurofighter or, potentially, the Franco-Hispano-German Future Combat Air System (FCAS). Although these initiatives are necessary, they often span long periods, which limits their immediate relevance in light of the strategic earthquake threatening the United States.It would be better to concentrate on boosting the production of weapons and munitions that can be used on the battlefield before the end of the decade, including by deploying certain industrial resources in Ukraine itself, as Germany and France intend to do.Furthermore, it will be urgently necessary to adapt European, national, and even regional regulations \u2014 particularly at the level of the German L\u00e4nder \u2014 which impact the most environmentally sensitive industries to the needs of national defense: for example, the REACH directive for the chemical industry, or the Seveso regulations for all high-risk activities. This will be a difficult and delicate task, as each of these texts is legitimate in its own right. But there is some leeway between regulating an activity and making it impossible for a period of time that is in keeping with the urgency of national defense in the face of an invader. This is true for the industrial sector, such as ammunition production, but also in operational terms. When France wanted to move \u201cLeclerc\u201d armored vehicles to Romania using tank carriers at the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, national and local regulations prohibited any such transport, particularly in the part of Germany dominated by ecologists. In the end, the journey was made by train, at a reasonably slow pace. We were able to recover, as Russia had not attacked Romania in the meantime.Finally, there is the military version of what Brussels insiders call \u201ctaxonomy\u201d, an issue that has pitted Germany against France in the energy sector: Berlin initially wanted gas, which has a high carbon content, as well as renewable energies, to have better access to government and capital market financing than nuclear power, which is a zero-carbon energy source. In terms of defense, this means being relegated to the lowest tier, alongside alcohol and tobacco, particularly in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR); a poor CSR rating complicates access to financial markets. The example of Estonia underscores the seriousness of this decision: it had set out to build an artillery production line, hoping to benefit from a line of credit from a Swedish bank, but the bank refused, citing CSR. Furthermore, decisions are often private, not public as CSR is also imposed by the markets. This is a significant obstacle to the revitalization of Europe\u2019s defense industries. These are all small pieces of the past, inherited from the world of yesterday, and they risk jeopardizing the efforts needed for a future that is already here.Without sweeping and rapid changes in these areas, Europe will, for a long time to come, continue to build bonsai armies on a continent where Russia will be steadily pushing its pawns forward, while the United States will watch this defeat from its distant position in the Indo-Pacific region.It is important to remember, however, that Europe remains important to the United States in its tug-of-war with China. On the one hand, the EU is an indispensable market for Chinese trade and technology. Its single market enables it to impose its standards, including in new technologies. Americans and Europeans alike have begun to understand this, with the creation in 2021 of a Euro-American body to address investment and technology trade with China. On the other hand, in military terms, Europe remains an essential hub for American access to the Indian Ocean: at the risk of surprising, the continent and its military assets are closer to American bases in the Indian Ocean than the American West Coast is to Taiwan and the South China Sea. In other words, Europe has some leverage with which to influence American choices. All that remains is to convince Donald Trump, should he be re-elected. This was not the case during his first term.Here too, it is time to lay the groundwork: by Tuesday November 5th, it will already be too late.The Europeanization of NATO?What remains to be done is to define the political and institutional framework within which Europe can support Ukraine and replace an America that is less present.In the past, this debate was theological, and therefore unsolvable and theoretical, and therefore largely divorced from reality. Some, especially the French, prayed for a European defense that never materialized. Others, by far the majority, relied on the Americans via NATO, for good reasons \u2014 such as their credibility in the face of Russia \u2014 as well as bad ones. For example, many countries tended to want to pay as little as possible for their defense, relying on the goodwill of the American taxpayer.The war in Ukraine has shaken things up. The Russian threat has become a reality, and an American withdrawal is likely at a time when the European Union is playing an essential role, both in terms of military aid to Ukraine and the revival of the defense industry. Paradoxically, NATO is taking a back seat, as Western military aid is bilateral, or supported by the EU in the case of Europeans. Coordination is also taking place within the Ramstein Group, which brings together 53 countries that go far beyond the NATO framework.The trend is now twofold: the growing role of the European Union in defense matters on the one hand, and the Europeanization of NATO on the other. With or without the Americans, NATO performs functions, has an organizational culture and a structure that European institutions do not possess: command structures, standardization of equipment, and interoperability of forces at all levels are shared assets that do not need to be reinvented. Moreover, in Europe, NATO includes the United Kingdom and Norway. The same applies mutatis mutandis to the European Union, which alone has the industrial and regulatory powers without which Europe could not defend itself. In short, NATO knows how to wage war, with or without the United States, and Europe is learning how to plan defense over the long term.In other words, the time has come to face reality. The French and their partners must stop praying for a European defense that remains entirely theoretical.NATO knows how to wage war, with or without the United States, and Europe is learning how to plan defense over the long term.Fran\u00e7ois HeisbourgBut what should we call this emerging convergence between the Union and NATO? Some English-speaking analysts are already talking about \u201cEuro-NATO\u201d. It\u2019s a start, but it treats the Union as if it were a synonym, which is probably not a good idea. When it comes to defense and strategy, as elsewhere, misnaming things contributes to the world\u2019s ills. So, if we must move quickly to bring about this convergence, we should not be in too much of a hurry to name it. Its name will be determined through experience.

American officials say the symbolism of the United States pulling back now could be profound for the war in Ukraine.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesBy David E. SangerReporting from BerlinFeb. 7, 2024A year ago, when Washington and much of Europe were still awash in optimism that Ukraine was on the verge of repelling Russia from its territory, it seemed inconceivable that the United States would turn its back on the victim of Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s aggression.Now, even as Senate Democrats try to salvage an aid package for Ukraine, that possibility remains real. And the political moment feels a long way from 14 months ago when President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine stood before a joint session of Congress, wearing his signature drab green sweater, and basked in a minute-long standing ovation.The turnaround has surprised the White House. Even if the Senate manages to advance military aid, there are still plenty of reasons to doubt that the money will come through, including deep opposition among Republicans in the House and former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s push for a more isolationist stance.President Biden\u2019s aides insist they are not yet scrambling for other options.\u201cWe\u2019re not focused on Plan B,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, said in Brussels on Wednesday after a NATO meeting with his counterparts. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on plan A,\u201d which he said meant passing a bipartisan aid package that will enable Ukraine to \u201cdefend effectively and to take back territory that Russia currently occupies.\u201dImageCongress\u2019 threat to derail the aid comes just at the moment that Europe  committed $54 billion for rebuilding the country over the next four years. Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesBut behind the scenes there is a lot of discussion, in Washington and Europe, about other options, including seizing more than $300 billion in Russian central bank assets that are stashed in Western nations \u2014 a process that is turning out to be a lot more complicated than it first seemed.Still, American officials concede there is nothing on the horizon that could match the power of a new, $60 billion congressional appropriation, which would buy bolstered air defenses, more tanks and missiles, and a huge influx of ammunition.And, they add, the symbolism of America pulling back now could be profound.European officials who have been dreading the possibility that Mr. Trump might be re-elected and make good on his promise to withdraw from NATO are beginning to wonder, at least in private, about the reliability of the United States, no matter who is president.If Republicans are willing to abide by Mr. Trump\u2019s demand that they vote against continued aid to Ukraine, one senior European diplomat in Berlin asked on Wednesday, why would Europe rely on Mr. Biden\u2019s assurance that the United States would \u201cdefend every inch\u201d of NATO territory? Even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security aides \u2014 the ones he long ago split with \u2014 are beginning to say that a failure to fund Ukraine would amount to a huge strategic win for Mr. Putin.\u201cThe United States has a clear choice: arm the Ukrainians with the weapons they need to defend themselves or cut off aid and abandon democratic Ukraine in its struggle for national survival against Putin\u2019s aggression,\u201d H.R. McMaster, who served for a year as the second of Mr. Trump\u2019s four national security advisers, said on Monday. He noted that while Congress debated, \u201cthe abandonment of Kyiv would be a gift to the Moscow-Tehran-Beijing-Pyongyang axis of aggressors. Allies and partners would lose trust in America as those aggressors are emboldened.\u201dOddly enough, Congress\u2019s threat to derail the aid comes just at the moment that Europe committed $54 billion for rebuilding the country over the next four years, and countries from Norway to Germany are committing new arms aid. \u201cIt is remarkable how quickly Europe has moved toward a new and substantive multiyear support program for Ukraine,\u201d said Christoph Trebesch, who directs the production of the Ukraine Support Tracker at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in northern Germany. \u201cFor the first time, the U.S. is now lagging behind by a large margin\u201d compared with European aid, he said.ImageIf the United States pulls the plug on its support for the war, much of the day-to-day military necessities will go away.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York Times\u201cThis is not charity; it is in our own security interest,\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, said at the alliance\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday, appearing at a news conference with Mr. Sullivan. A Russian victory, he added, \u201cmatters for European security and it matters for American security.\u201dBut this argument, that the West must push back on Russia in Ukraine or face the possibility of fighting it on NATO territory, seems to be losing its effectiveness in Congress. And some Republican members of Congress are still accusing Europe of not pulling its weight, even if the newest financial commitments change the equation.But none of these arguments, officials in the U.S. and Europe say, can overcome the reality: If the United States pulls the plug on its financial support for the war, much of the day-to-day military necessities will go away \u2014 starting with air defense against the near-daily barrages of missiles, drones and other weaponry aimed at urban centers and critical infrastructure like the electric grid. And if the country\u2019s economy collapses, it will terminate a two-year-long effort to save a fledgling if deeply flawed democracy.The Republicans opposing the aid don\u2019t argue directly with that logic, though many insist that pouring billions into a country with a deep history of corruption invites misuse. Instead, their primary argument is that the money should be spent at home, on the southern border rather than Ukraine\u2019s borderlands with Russia. The most outspoken of the opponents, including Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida, contend that Ukraine aid \u201cputs America last.\u201dFor months, the White House saw them as a fringe group. But polling shows that the percentage of Republican voters who say the United States has spent too much defending the country is soaring. And now many Republicans have grown resistant, aligning their own views with the long-held position espoused by Mr. Trump, who in the 2016 campaign said he did not want to defend Ukraine. Eight years later he is insisting \u2014 without offering any details \u2014 that he would end the war in 24 hours.ImageAs the war enters its third year, Ukrainians are facing more difficulty in the conflict.Credit...Finbarr O'Reilly for The New York TimesNow the opposition has so taken hold that even the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who has declared time and again that funding the war in Ukraine was one of his top priorities, seemed to be backpedaling.Meanwhile, Mr. Biden\u2019s aides are trying to figure out how to pay for weapons if Congress remains paralyzed. The plan to seize Russian assets has complications. It\u2019s not clear that the reserves could be used to pay for air defense and artillery. Even that, administration officials say, could require congressional action \u2014 though presumably there are more votes in the House and Senate for spending Russia\u2019s money than spending the United States\u2019.There is also discussion of conducting complex weapons swaps, similar to what Japan and South Korea have done, where they have provided their artillery shells to the United States, freeing up Washington to give more to Ukraine. (Both countries have said they could not export directly to a war zone.) Or, perhaps, have European nations pay for American weapons and ship those to Ukraine.But Europe clearly doesn\u2019t have the capacity to provide much more ammunition by itself. During the 30 years of increasingly uneasy peace with Russia, Europe dismantled much of its production capability. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in a recent speech that \u201cwe will have delivered over half a million rounds of artillery shells by next month\u201d and \u201cmore than one million by the end of the year,\u201d but she acknowledged that \u201cthis is certainly not enough.\u201dEurope also has little to contribute to drone manufacturing. And Germany remains unwilling to turn over its most powerful long-range, air-launched cruise missile, the Taurus, for fear it will be used deep inside Russian territory. Germany\u2019s role is bound to be at the center of a meeting between Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Mr. Biden at the White House on Friday.Mr. Sullivan, for his part, insists that if the administration sticks to its strategy, it will prevail. \u201cWalking away from Ukraine at this moment, at this time, would be fundamentally wrong from the point of view of our basic national security in the United States and for our NATO allies, as well,\u2019\u2019 he said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd we think we will continue to win that argument.\u201dSteven Erlanger contributed reporting from Oslo.David E.

Ukrainian servicemen in Zhytomyr. 30 January 2024.          Marek KohvThe West must make serious efforts to change the course of the war in Ukraine. Government orders for the defence industry should be long-term, and in addition to military aid, there must be a renewed push for sanctions to strangle Russia\u2019s war machine in Ukraine. Unconventional methods, such as using intelligence information in court, should also be considered for use in freezing or confiscating Russian assets abroad.By now, it is quite likely that neither Ukraine nor Russia will be able to achieve significant changes on the frontlines this year. Both sides need time to replenish their resources, which have been depleted by the two years of war. Russia has redirected its already battered economy towards the defence industry and is steadily rebuilding its stockpiles, though not to the extent and capability suggested by the official channels. Nevertheless, in 2024, Russia holds the advantage over Ukraine in terms of military capability.In the west, we must work to create the necessary conditions to ensure that Kyiv can prevail on the battlefield at least in 2025. The Estonian Ministry of Defence has proposed a suitable long-term strategy that would, for instance, require each Ramstein coalition country to contribute 0.25% of GDP to military assistance to Ukraine. If countries follow this plan in a synchronised manner rather than sporadically, a military victory for Ukraine on its own territory becomes achievable.Beyond the BattlefieldHowever, ending the war is not solely a matter of what happens on the battlefield. The decision to end the war must be made by either the attacking party by stating that its objectives have been achieved or the losing party by surrendering. Ukraine cannot surrender because this is an existential war for it. I shudder to think of the consequences for Ukraine if the occupiers were to seize power. The aggressor has already provided some glimpses into its plans in places like Bucha, Izyum, and Kherson.At the same time, Putin has repeatedly stated that neither have Russia\u2019s objectives in Ukraine changed nor been accomplished. One of those objectives was to topple the legitimate government in Kyiv. We should not assume that merely capturing or losing territory would change the aggressor\u2019s intentions. But Ukraine\u2019s victory on the battlefield is certainly a prerequisite for the Kremlin to even consider other options.Any expectation of a spontaneous purging of the Putin regime and declaration of an end to the war overnight is unrealistic. Similarly, the regime voluntarily handing itself over to a tribunal is improbable. A voluntary regime change is possible but highly unlikely. Even if it were to happen, the old regime would negotiate immunity for its crimes. This was evident in the last real change of power in Russia when Putin secured his predecessor\u2019s immunity through a decree, as Yeltsin\u2019s main concern at that time was domestic corruption investigations.Another option is that the old regime is deposed, and its members face trial. Currently, this scenario is also improbable. When considering the two scenarios together, history indicates that the latter is more likely to occur yet would still require significant societal dissatisfaction. The latest examples include Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s departure from power in 2000 and the removal of Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. It must be noted, however, that the level of suppression in Russian society today is much greater than what Serbia or Ukraine were experiencing at the time.Harnessing Intelligence DataSanctions are essential to influence Russia\u2019s leadership and strangle its war machine. Existing sanctions must be rigorously enforced to prevent any loopholes. The Russian elite with close ties to the current regime must be completely deprived of the ability to live a comfortable and affluent life in the west. Assets held by shell companies and nominees must be frozen or confiscated.How can this be achieved? It is crucial to bear in mind that any reputable western intelligence agency probably should know about any individuals who reside within their jurisdiction and are linked to the current Russian leadership under surveillance, and especially about their interactions with their home country.It is reasonable to discuss whether and how the assets of the aggressor\u2019s elite could be confiscated in a simplified manner. Typically, intelligence is not gathered with the intention of using it in court. Its purpose is to create situational awareness and complement informed decision-making in national defence. However, the current circumstances provide an opportune moment to consider whether information collected by the various intelligence disciplines could be justifiably used as grounds for freezing or confiscating Russian assets.We live in an era where it is possible to eliminate terrorists in almost any corner of the world based on intelligence information. Therefore, we should at least be open to discussing how intelligence data could be employed in mapping Russian assets and temporarily freezing them pending a court investigation. As of now, European countries have varying approaches to the extent and impact of using intelligence information in legal proceedings.The Importance of the Defence IndustryUkraine\u2019s domestic drone and missile industry needs additional support because it represents the only means through which Ukraine can exert influence on Russian territory, which brings awareness of the war to Russian society. If these attacks can only be carried out with Ukrainian-made weapons, countries that fear escalation when a NATO member\u2019s weapons are used to attack Russian territory can maintain their stance.The Russian leadership, no matter how autocratic, still depends on the opinions and attitudes of its people. Living under constant fear of missile attacks and experiencing even a fraction of the horrors endured by Ukrainian people may eventually change public opinion and support for the war in Russian society where support for the war is still prevalent. Even the organisations representing the mothers and wives of Russian soldiers are not campaigning against the war; instead, they are advocating for the swift return of their loved ones from the front lines.However, relying solely on the Ukrainian domestic industry will not suffice for a military triumph. Western support must be sustained at a level that enables Ukraine to defeat Russia on the battlefield. There is a significant shortage of air defence systems and ammunition. Moreover, air defence is primarily a defensive capability and, as such, is critical to protect the civilian population from the aggressor\u2019s crimes. To launch a new offensive, however, it is essential to achieve superiority in indirect fire capabilities. Thus, a substantial influx of artillery ammunition and systems is required.Additionally, Kyiv needs more long-range impact weapon systems to influence Russian assembly areas and disrupt the enemy\u2019s logistics and the work of command posts. And, of course, the Ukrainian troops constantly rely on more equipment, supplies, and trained personnel to sustain their effort. There is no single weapon system or type of ammunition that can magically solve Ukraine\u2019s problems. Ukraine is engaged in full-scale conventional warfare, where cooperation between all branches of the military and various weapon systems is necessary for success. The axiom holds true: quantity has a quality all its own.The reality is grim \u2013 Western reserves are running low, and the new production capacities are not yet sufficient. Many promises made in 2022 and 2023 to multiply ammunition production will only materialise by the end of this or next year. Public calls by politicians to boost industrial production are encouraging but often remain empty slogans because companies are awaiting orders, not just motivational speeches. Estonian proposal for the procurement of up to a million artillery shells in the EU collectively was relevant one year ago. But after failing to deliver it on (the promised) schedule, Europe should strive to be more ambitious. In Ukraine\u2019s Defence Minister Rustem Umarov\u2019s estimates, Moscow\u2019s artillery usage is up to 6\u00a0000 shells daily, whereas Kyiv is able to respond with only around a third of that amount. The demand will skyrocket if an offensive \u2014 by either side \u2014 starts. Meanwhile, Ukraine effectively needs close to 3 million artillery shells per year.The defence industry requires assurance that if a company invests in new facilities and personnel, it will recoup its investment. The reluctance of Western governments to commit to long-term agreements with the defence industry is perplexing. In the meantime, national stockpiles are already depleting, many countries are increasing their defence budgets (and thus procurement spending), and supporting Ukraine will undoubtedly remain on the agenda for at least the next three to four years.The Russian Threat PersistsParadoxically, the Russian threat will not dissipate regardless of whether it suffers defeat or triumphs in Ukraine.Under the first scenario, there might be substantial pressure on the Kremlin to embark on a victorious venture elsewhere. In the second case, the regime might perceive itself as invincible and be tempted to repeat its victory in another campaign \u201cagainst NATO.\u201d Hence, if we aim for Ukraine\u2019s success on the battlefield and wish to foster internal changes in Russia, western nations must sustain their long-term preparedness. Ultimately, we are defending ourselves.This article was written for\u00a0ICDS Diplomaatia magazine.

The war follows on Russian territorial aggression against its neighbor that began in 2014 with the illegal annexation of Crimea and a proxy war in the eastern Donbas region.Tracking developments in the Ukraine war, the Brookings Institution \u2014 in partnership with The Washington Post \u2014 presents the Ukraine Index, which compiles security, economic, and political data presented in graphic form. Our purpose is to provide updated information on such key metrics as changes in the control of Ukrainian territory by the two sides, the amount of support for Ukraine from the U.S. and Europe as well the political support for continued aid, and the health of the Ukrainian economy. Our Ukraine Index is intended to contribute to our understanding of this conflict, and thereby to a more informed public debate.We will update the index regularly and expand or amend the featured data as circumstances change. The data itself is taken from a variety of sources (government, international organizations, private). Since tracking data from the Ukraine war has been under dangerous circumstances in a war zone, it is of necessity approximative or incomplete.SecurityThe war in Ukraine, now in its second year, remains an unpredictable conflict, yet the Ukrainian people\u2019s unwavering bravery and resilience continue to inspire. Key battlefield trends \u2014 such as territorial control, drones and cruise missiles interceptions, and U.S. security assistance \u2014 reveal the ongoing dynamics of the conflict.

FORCES ARM\u00e9ES UKRAINIENNES VIA AFP   The change of stance is official. Three months after the failure of its counter-offensive launched with great hope in June 2023 but which broke down on Russian fortifications along the front line, Ukraine has resolved to lower its ambitions. \"We have moved from offensive action to a defensive operation,\" said the new commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, General Oleksandr Syrsky, in a short interview broadcast on February 13 by the German channel ZDF, almost two years after the launch of Moscow's \"special military operation.\" The Ukrainian army has little choice. The density of Russian minefields \u2013 up to five explosive devices per square meter, up to 15 to 20 kilometers wide \u2013 has made a mechanized breakthrough illusory, at least with the breaching equipment currently available to Kyiv. Similarly, the thousands of observation drones that fly over the front line every day have, according to the military, made the battlefield \"transparent,\" preventing any concentration of forces. As soon as vehicles or troops are grouped together, they are targeted by artillery or hunted down by explosive drones.

In the absence of an agreement in the United States Congress between Democrats and Republicans, the US has not delivered shells and rockets to Ukraine since the beginning of the year, and Europeans are still struggling to revive their arms factories. To make up for their lack of artillery, Kyiv's army does make extensive use of so-called \"FPV\" (First Person View) drones, which are remotely piloted with immersive goggles and are therefore highly accurate, but they are not enough to make up the difference with Russia. According to analysts, the \"fire ratio,\" which measures the difference in the volume of artillery fire between two belligerents, is now one to 10, or even 12, in Russia's favor. \"The Ukrainians can't hold out with such a ratio without losing a lot of men. It's more reasonable for them to fall back on defensive positions that are valued,\" said St\u00e9phane Audrand, international risk consultant and reserve officer.

In the east of the country, in the Donetsk oblast, they are building a network of forts protecting each other. Further north, in the Kharkiv oblast, and south in the Zaporizhzhia region, at least two lines of defense are being built around urban centers and strategic axes. \"Digging for protection is a constant feature of warfare. The Ukrainian conflict is no exception, despite all the technology deployed,\" said a French military source. You have 72.16% of this article left to read.

Confident initial predictions of a swift Russian triumph were repeatedly proven wrong. Instead, Russia\u2019s military was beset by poor logistics, corruption, a sclerotic command structure and an inability to counter Ukrainian tactics. Kyiv\u2019s armed forces successfully prevented a rash Russian attempt to seize the Ukrainian capital and then stopped the entire Russian advance. After six months, they began turning the Russian invaders back, recapturing swathes of territory around Kharkov in the north and Kherson in the south. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was feted by Western leaders, parlaying his personal popularity into commitments of military aid and insisting Ukraine could prevail with a more sophisticated arsenal.Yet for all these early successes, the war soon devolved into repeated human waves of attacks by Russian conscripts against well-defended Ukrainian positions. The slow drip-feed of Western weapons forced Kyiv to significantly delay its 2023 counteroffensive. This gave Russia\u2019s armed forces time to design deep and elaborate defensive fortifications, minefields and tank traps.

Nearly a year later, Russian forces captured the town.Libkos/APIndeed, thanks largely to Russian efforts, Ukraine is now the most heavily mined country in the world.Once Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive commenced, its forces made little headway and took heavy losses, especially given the lack of air support. Facing personnel and equipment shortages, Zelensky dramatically fired his military chief, Valerii Zaluzhny, earlier this month, opting for a new strategy that seeks to build Ukrainian strength while blocking further Russian advances.Russia: weakened, but determinedAfter being humiliated by failing to immediately achieve the objectives of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in early 2022, the Kremlin attempted to cow an obstinately united West through bluff and bluster, while bludgeoning Ukrainian cities and military positions. It repeatedly rattled nuclear sabres, mobilised isolationist and far-right groups throughout Europe and warned of a looming world war. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rhetoric bordered on unhinged, punctuated by rants about the moral decrepitude of \u201cSatanic\u201d Western culture that only Russian traditional values could resist. Tellingly, in a rare moment of honesty, Putin also admitted the obvious: invading Ukraine was about restoring what he saw as Russia\u2019s \u201chistoric lands\u201d. While mobilising hundreds of thousands of men for sacrifice in the Ukrainian meat-grinder, the Kremlin sought to project an image of a society overseen by a stable, albeit xenophobic troika. Putin was the wise tsar, the Orthodox Church was the steward of Russia\u2019s conservative soul and the military served as Russia\u2019s armoured bulwark. Vladimir Putin visiting a military training centre in the Ryazan region of Russia.Mikhail Klimentyev/Pool Sputnik Kremlin/APWith no good news to report, Kremlin propagandists created a bizarre narrative in which Russia was defending itself against NATO aggression, liberally labelling Russia\u2019s opponents as \u201cNazis\u201d. But this failed to mask the reality that Russia itself was increasingly becoming Nazified, as its hyper-nationalist \u201cZ\u201d movement made clear. So, too, did repeated genocidal and antisemitic language: Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u2019s crude observation that both Adolf Hitler and Zelensky had Jewish bloodcomparisons between Ukrainians and vermin and overt calls by Kremlin-sponsored propagandists for a \u201csolution of the Ukrainian question\u201d.Simultaneously, Russia\u2019s draconian crackdown on internal dissent resulted in lengthy jail terms for anyone found guilty of criticising the war or army.Russian police detain an anti-war protester against in St.Petersburg in the early days of the conflict.Anatoly Maltsev/EPARussia\u2019s failures also brought the audacious revolt in June 2023 by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, and one of Putin\u2019s closest confidantes. And despite Prigozhin\u2019s subsequently convenient death, the fact he had managed to march largely unchallenged through Russia until voluntarily stopping 200 kilometres from Moscow made Putin look considerably weakened.However, with the start of 2024, Russia\u2019s forces have started pressing again on the battlefield, making small territorial gains.A recent report puts the current number of Russian military personnel in Ukraine at 470,000. And although it is believed to have lost a staggering 8,800 armoured fighting vehicles and some 315,000 dead and wounded \u2013 fully 90% of the forces it began the war with \u2013 the Russian armed forces have finally begun to adapt.

It will be decisive for Putin\u2019s wager that conquest comes without consequences, perhaps emboldening him to sets his sights on other states on its periphery.  It will confirm whether Europe can remain stabilised, secure and united, and whether America will continue to be seen as a reliable ally.For the Kremlin, the key question is whether it can keep domestic discontent muted long enough for the West to lose interest in the war and withdraw its support for Ukraine. It is unlikely to run out of weapons, having massively ramped up domestic production of armaments and sourcing drones and ammunition from a rogues\u2019 gallery of pariahs: Iran and North Korea. Ukraine, which is fighting for national survival, faces a tougher and grimmer 2024. It will need to continue absorbing relentless Russian attacks, keep its economy afloat and rebuild its military strength for yet another attempt to evict Russia\u2019s forces.Zelensky\u2019s famous \u201cI need ammunition, not a ride\u201d response to a US offer to evacuate him in 2022 holds just as true two years later. Without a constant stream of military aid, Ukrainian resistance will be very hard to sustain.

This is causing ammunition shortages that are already being measured in Ukrainian lives and territory. But a far greater threat lies on the horizon, in the real prospect of a second Donald Trump presidency. Putin is well aware Trump will give him a free hand in Ukraine and probably beyond it, too. Accordingly, he is investing significant efforts to back his candidacy. The extraordinary spectacle of Putin \u2013 the leader of a hostile foreign power \u2013 using an \u201cinterview\u201d with ex-Fox News personality Tucker Carlson to rally the Trump base was a keen indicator of that.Europe is finally beginning to wake up to the reality a Trump-led US could abandon NATO, in addition to Ukraine. But whether European nations are able to overcome their institutional inertia and webs of entangled interests to stoutly resist Russia on their own remains an open question.It\u2019s an old adage, but wars are world-shaping. Their outcomes are far-reaching: redrawing maps, establishing new fault lines, and ushering in the birth and death of nations. Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is proving to be no different.NATORussiaVladimir PutinUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraine invasion 2022Ukraine-Russian warWant to write?

Those issues recently soured ties between the neighbors.Ukraine\u2019s allies have recently sought to reassure the country that they are committed to its long-term defense amid concerns that Western support could be flagging. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France\u2019s new foreign minister also traveled to Kyiv in the new year.Tusk, who returned to power last month and is keen to show that a change in government won\u2019t alter its Ukraine policy, also met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Denys Shmyhal.

He returned to Polish politics after serving as president of the European Council \u2014 one of the European Union\u2019s top jobs.He framed the war as a wider struggle between Europe and Russia that had repercussions beyond Ukraine, making it a priority for Poland.\u201cToday Ukraine is shouldering the security matters of the entire European continent, today Ukraine is paying the huge price of blood for the values that are fundamental to the free world,\u201d he said. \u201cPoland\u2019s security is also at stake in this struggle.\u201dZelenskyy described the talks as \u201cvery productive\u201d and said Poland\u2019s new military aid would include a loan allowing Ukraine to purchase big-ticket weapons. They also assessed opportunities for joint arms production, he said, in line with similar discussions with other allies.Tusk\u2019s visit came a day after Moscow-installed officials in eastern Ukraine reported that Ukrainian shelling killed 27 people on the outskirts of Russian-occupied Donetsk. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called it a \u201cmonstrous terrorist act,\u201d and the Russia-backed local authorities declared a day of mourning.The Ukrainian military, however, denied it had anything to do with the attack.It was not immediately possible to verify either side\u2019s claims.Located on NATO\u2019s eastern flank, Poland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s strongest allies. Warsaw has provided weapons and humanitarian aid, and opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees since Moscow invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.But relations soured last year as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers angered Poles who said their livelihoods were under threat. Polish farmers and truckers blocked border crossings, causing backups and threatening the flow of some aid to Ukraine. Polish farmers complained that imports of Ukrainian foods had caused prices to fall, hurting their incomes, while truckers said they were being undercut by their Ukrainian counterparts. The issue surfaced during the war as Ukrainian ports were blocked and food producers turned to road routes through Europe to get their products to market.At one point, Poland and some other European nations banned Ukrainian grain imports because of the trade dispute. Poland\u2019s farmers and trucks have ended the protests for now. Tusk has said Warsaw wants to help Ukraine economically but not at the expense of Polish businesses. He has previously suggested that Kyiv needs to better regulate its trucking industry.Tusk was also scheduled to honor the country\u2019s fighters and attend observances of Ukraine\u2019s Day of Unity, which commemorates the merger in 1919 that brought together its eastern and western regions.As part of the celebration, Zelenskyy signed a decree that, among other things, instructs the government to preserve the national identity of Ukrainians living in border regions that are now part of Russia, such as Belgorod, Kursk and Briansk. Some of those areas have recently been targeted by Kyiv\u2019s forces.The decree also aims to establish a center for investigating crimes against Ukrainians on those territories, including forced Russification, political persecutions, and deportations.In other war-related developments, Ukraine\u2019s air force said it intercepted all eight Shahed drones that Russia launched overnight over southern and central regions of Ukraine.Debris from three drones shot down over the central Dnipropetrovsk region started a fire at an unidentified business but no casualties were reported.Elsewhere, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi visited Kharkiv on the third day of his tour of the country. The second-largest city was among the targets of a Jan. 16 Russian missile attack that injured 17 civilians.Later, Grandi visited children at a school that has relocated to the city\u2019s subway system.Meanwhile, major Ukrainian digital banking platform Monobank said it came under a massive denial-of-service attack by unidentified hackers. The attack was successfully repelled, the bank said, with no major consequences. ___Monika Scislowska contributed from Warsaw, Poland.___This story has been corrected to show that Denys Shmyhal is Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, not defense minister.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Released Thursday, it was Putin\u2019s first interview with a Western media figure since the invasion.

He suggested Moscow wants the release of a Russian imprisoned in Germany.White House national security spokesman John Kirby tried to minimize the impact of Carlson\u2019s interview ahead of its release, saying, \u201cRemember, you\u2019re listening to Vladimir Putin. And you shouldn\u2019t take at face value anything he has to say.\u201dRussian media on Friday gave the interview blanket coverage, with major broadcasters showing excerpts and one state news agency describing it as \u201ca dagger blow through the curtain of propaganda of the dishonest media of the civilized world.\u201dBefore leaving Fox, Carlson repeatedly questioned the validity of U.S. support for Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion, asking why Americans are told to hate Putin so much. His commentaries were frequently circulated on Russian state-run media. Asked why the Kremlin granted Carlson\u2019s interview request out of many from Western media, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the former Fox host\u2019s position is different from a \u201cone-sided\u201d stance by other outlets.Putin has heavily limited his contact with international media since invading Ukraine in February 2022. Russian authorities have cracked down on independent media at home, forcing some outlets to close and blocking others, while also ordering a number of foreign reporters to leave. Besides the Journal\u2019s Gershkovich, it also has jailed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\u2019s Alsu Kurmasheva.Asked by Carlson if Russia would release Gershkovich, Putin said Moscow is open to talks but repeated he was charged with espionage, an accusation Gershkovich denies. \u201cHe was caught red-handed when he was secretly getting classified information,\u201d Putin said, adding that he doesn\u2019t exclude the reporter could return home. In a statement, the Journal reaffirmed that Gershkovich \u201cis a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,\u201d adding that \u201cany portrayal to the contrary is total fiction.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged to see Russia\u2019s desire for a deal that brings Evan home, and we hope this will lead to his rapid release and return to his family and our newsroom,\u201d it said.Putin said Russia is \u201cready to solve it but there are certain conditions that are being discussed between special services. I believe an agreement can be reached.\u201dHe pointed to a man imprisoned in a \u201cU.S.-allied country\u201d for \u201cliquidating a bandit\u201d who had killed Russian soldiers during fighting in the Caucasus. Putin didn\u2019t mention names but appeared to refer to Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany after being convicted of the 2019 killing of Zelimkhan \u201cTornike\u201d Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen ethnicity. German judges said Krasikov acted on the orders of Russian authorities, who gave him a false identity and passport and resources to carry out the killing.The Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

But it has not answered the fundamental question of what a winning \u2013 or even surviving \u2013 strategy in the war with Russia could look like as it moves into its third year.Several dynamics have come together that are deeper and more complex than just a major reshuffle of the military leadership. The bigger picture that will shape the future of the war \u2013 and with it the future of Ukraine and the European and international security order \u2013 comprises four main factors. These need to be analysed together to understand the present, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 the future predicaments of Ukraine and its western partners. First, the failure of the Ukrainian counter-offensive in 2023 and the increasing pressure that Russia has put on Ukraine\u2019s frontlines and hinterland put into serious question the ability of Kyiv to win. This is especially the case if victory for Ukraine means forcing Russia\u2019s complete withdrawal from all territory occupied since 2014. The impending fall of Avdiivka, a town about 20kms to the west of Donetsk in the east of Ukraine, suggests that Kyiv ultimately has a weaker hand to play in a battle of attrition when confronted by a ruthless adversary with greater resources.There is heavy fighting around the town of Avdiivka which is expected to fall to Russian forces in the next few days.Institute for the Study of WarMuch like the loss of Bakhmut in May 2023, or Soledar in January 2023, this was a symbolic rather than strategic defeat for Ukraine. It also represents, at best, pyrrhic victories for Russia \u2013 as in the case of Bakhmut.But taken together, and seen in the context of the failed 2023 counter-offensive, these were not just symbolic defeats. They marked a real and  extremely wasteful loss of financial resources, manpower and military equipment. Zelensky\u2019s dismissal of Zaluzhny puts the blame for last year\u2019s disappointed hopes clearly on the latter. It also indicates, more worryingly, a lack of learning the lessons of these setbacks on the part of the Ukrainian president. The fact that the new commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, is associated with several of these costly defeats \u2013 notably Bakhmut \u2013 does not bode well for the necessary change in Ukrainian strategy.To his credit, Syrsky also masterminded the defence of Kyiv in the early days of the war in 2022 and the successful counter-offensive the following summer which saw Ukraine recapture significant territory first around Kharkiv in the north and then Kherson in the south. Notably, these successes happened before Russia embarked on the first of several mobilisations and shifted its economy to a war footing.Faltering international supportThe second key factor to keep in mind is that Ukraine\u2019s battlefield successes in 2022 occurred at a time when western support for Ukraine was in full swing. Those days are long gone. This has been evident in the protracted battles in the US congress over sending more military aid to Ukraine. The comments by former president \u2013 and 2024 Republic nominee-apparent \u2013 Donald Trump on his lack of commitment to Nato should he be reelected in November are equally worrisome.Blamed for failure of 2023 counter-offensive: Ukraine\u2019s outgoing military commander, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.EPA-EFE/Oleg PetrasyukDespite some detractors, the EU remains committed to support for Ukraine. This became clear following the recent agreement on a new \u20ac50 billion (\u00a342.7 billion) funding package for Ukraine through 2027. But this will barely cover Ukraine\u2019s budget deficit, let alone make up for a potentially significant drop in US military aid. Combined with Ukraine\u2019s own shrinking domestic capabilities to mobilise further resources, the war will have to be fought in far more difficult conditions than in the first two years.War fatigueMeanwhile, Ukrainian society is increasingly suffering from war fatigue. Military setbacks, economic decline, deteriorating living conditions, corruption and the scale of the loss of lives \u2013 among troops and civilians alike \u2013 makes sustaining the war effort at present levels more difficult as well. Especially if the goal remains retaking all the land that Russia has occupied since 2014.The amended law on mobilisation, intended to underpin this strategy, was adopted in the Ukrainian parliament on February 6. Its provisions, including lowering the conscription age from 27 to 25 years, mandatory digital certificates and electronic prescription notifications and stricter penalties for evading military service, are further evidence of the waning enthusiasm in Ukrainian society for the war effort.Together with yet another 90-day extension of martial law and several financial measures designed to tighten the government\u2019s control over the economy, the more draconian provisions in the new mobilisation law also heighten the sense of uncertainty over Ukraine\u2019s political direction. Zelensky\u2019s presidential term comes to an end in May 2024 and new parliamentary elections would normally be due in the autumn. While it is generally agreed that elections are close to impossible at present, both the president\u2019s and parliament\u2019s legitimacy after the expiry of their constitutional terms will be open to question. This will ultimately be an issue for the constitutional court to resolve. But it has not stopped political forces within Ukraine opposed to Zelensky and his Servant of the People political party to pile pressure on the president to agree to a government of national unity. Given the lack of popularity of this opposition, associated primarily with former president Petro Poroshenko \u2013 who Zelensky defeated in a landslide election in 2019 \u2013 this is hardly driven by popular demand. But it nonetheless signals further political turmoil at a time when Ukraine needs unity. It is not clear whether Zelensky\u2019s dismissal of Zaluzhny will strengthen or weaken any political opposition. In the short term, it is likely to benefit Zelensky whose popularity still dwarfs that of Poroshenko. Yet, because replacing Zaluzhny has not come with a signal that Ukraine\u2019s war strategy will fundamentally change, this is a very risky move on the part of Zelensky. Maintaining the current direction asks Ukrainians for yet more sacrifices.

BarnesReporting from WashingtonJan. 30, 2024The war in Ukraine has \u201cquietly corroded\u201d the power of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, wrote in an essay published on Tuesday.While Mr. Putin\u2019s grip on power was unlikely to soon weaken, Mr. Burns wrote in Foreign Affairs, disaffection had \u201cgnawed away at the Russian leadership and the Russian people,\u201d allowing the C.I.A. to recruit more spies.The agency has made a series of videos aimed at recruiting Russian officials. The most recent, released last week, encourages Russians to securely provide information to the C.I.A. using a secure browser on the dark web. The latest video makes an appeal to their anger over corruption in the Russian government.While the U.S. government will not say how many spies have been recruited with the videos, officials said the agency would not have continued to push them on Telegram and YouTube if they were not effective. Mr. Burns echoed this sentiment in his article.\u201cThat undercurrent of disaffection is creating a once-in-a-generation recruiting opportunity for the C.I.A.,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are not letting it go to waste.\u201dPart of Mr. Putin\u2019s weakness stems from his handling of the mutiny last year by members of Russia\u2019s most powerful mercenary group. He looked \u201cdetached and indecisive\u201d in the face of the mutiny led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, Mr. Burns wrote.Mr. Burns wrote that Mr. Putin \u201ceventually settled his score with Prigozhin,\u201d a reference to the mercenary leader\u2019s death in a suspicious plane crash. Despite that, the critique of Russian leadership that Mr. Prigozhin put in front of the Russian people \u201cwill not soon disappear,\u201d Mr. Burns wrote.ImagePresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in a photograph released by Russian state news.Credit...Sputnik, via Reuters\u201cFor many in the Russian elite, the question was not so much whether the emperor had no clothes as why he was taking so long to get dressed,\u201d Mr. Burns said.Russia has rebuilt its military industrial production, but its economy has been deeply wounded by the war, he said. And long term, Russia is \u201csealing its fate\u201d to be a vassal of China, dependent on Beijing for trade and technology.Ukraine faces challenges in the war but has achieved dramatic results. Russia\u2019s efforts to modernize its military has been \u201chollowed out,\u201d and 315,000 Russians have been killed or wounded, Mr. Burns wrote.Ukraine has also suffered deep casualties, though Mr. Burns did not touch on that directly. U.S. officials have struggled to estimate precisely how many lives have been lost in Ukraine.Mr. Putin\u2019s strategy is to continue to grind down Ukraine and try to outlast Western support. But Ukraine, Mr. Burns wrote, can \u201cpuncture Putin\u2019s arrogance\u201d by launching strikes deeper behind the hardened front lines of the battlefield. In the past, U.S. officials have worried that Ukraine\u2019s attacks might cause Russia to escalate, even possibly by conducting a nuclear test as a warning to Ukraine and the West.Mr. Burns acknowledged that concerns about nuclear escalation were valid but suggested they should not be exaggerated.\u201cPutin might engage again in nuclear saber-rattling, and it would be foolish to dismiss escalatory risks entirely,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it would be equally foolish to be unnecessarily intimidated by them.\u201dThe key to Ukraine\u2019s success, Mr. Burns wrote, was to continue providing U.S. aid.Congress is considering a new package of military aid, but it has become entangled with the politics of a border and immigration deal on Capitol Hill.Cutting off Ukraine, Mr. Burns wrote, would be a huge mistake.\u201cKeeping the arms flowing will put Ukraine in a stronger position if an opportunity for serious negotiations emerges,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cIt offers a chance to ensure a long-term win for Ukraine and a strategic loss for Russia; Ukraine could safeguard its sovereignty and rebuild, while Russia would be left to deal with the enduring costs of Putin\u2019s folly.\u201dRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine ushered in a new era for the C.I.A., Mr. Burns wrote. He spoke of the early warning of the coming invasion that intelligence agencies provided the Biden administration, Ukraine and allies.But the new era, Mr. Burns said, was also about taking advantages of new technologies, including artificial intelligence. Those have transformed how the C.I.A. collects intelligence, allowing it to analyze information faster and more efficiently. \u201cAs much as the world is changing, espionage remains an interplay between humans and technology,\u201d he wrote.While there will be secrets that only humans can collect, Mr. Burns continued, the C.I.A. must \u201cblend mastery of emerging technologies with the people-to-people skills and individual daring that have always been at the heart of our profession.\u201dJulian E.

The toll, thus far, has been staggering. The total number of troops killed and wounded on both sides is likely well over half a million.Over 11 million Ukrainians have either become refugees or been internally displaced. Over a million Russian citizens fled to avoid conscription. Billions of dollars\u2019 worth of equipment have been destroyed.The war continues to reverberate globally with slowed economic growth, rising inflation, volatile energy prices, and food shortages \u2014especially in Africa and the Middle East.As Russia increasingly turns into a military dictatorship, conflict with the West has become raison d\u2019etre for the Kremlin, which casts the war as an existential battle for Russia. It is a system that can only justify its existence by conflict and thus cannot afford peace.Putin remains committed to a strategy of waiting for the West to lose its resolve and abandon Ukraine while simultaneously erasing Ukrainian identity and history.Western unity and commitment are increasingly in question, with the future of US military aid to the country hanging in the balance. The coming year may be decisive for both sides in the fighting and the global order.Stalemate?A consensus has formed in Western discourse over the last several months that the war in Ukraine has reached a stalemate.The idea took hold around early November, when\u00a0The Economist\u00a0quoted Ukraine\u2019s commander-in-chief, General Valery Zaluzhny, as saying, \u201cJust as the First World War, we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate\u201d, and it would take a massive technological leap to break the deadlock.Ukraine experts have noted that Zaluzhny\u2019s use of the term \u201cstalemate\u201d was both unfortunate and misunderstood, as the key was his reference to \u201ccurrent technology.\u201dZaluzhny\u2019s comments in the original Ukrainian better conveyed his message: he warned about finding Ukraine in a \u201chlukhyy kut\u201d (literally \u201cdeaf corner,\u201d or a dead end) if Ukraine does not get the military aid it needs.Regardless of Ukraine\u2019s continued ability to destroy the Russian\u00a0Black Sea Fleet\u00a0and interrupt train lines in the far east of Russian territory, the perception of a stalemate has taken hold.\u00a0It is buoyed by a misplaced assessment of the Ukrainian counter-offensive as failing and the reality that Western expectations were wildly out of sync with what was needed to achieve such results.Webster\u2019s dictionary describes a stalemate as a \u201cdeadlock\u201d. Similarly, military experts described a stalemate in war as a situation when \u201cneither side can change the front lines dramatically no matter how hard it tries.\u201d In other words, a stalemate is where neither side has any moves left that can alter the outcome.By this definition, the war in Ukraine is not at a stalemate. Both sides have several moves left to alter the war\u2019s outcome. The ability to do so largely depends on the commitment of resources, the will to fight, and the impact of activities across all domains\u2014not just the land war.What Moves Are Left?First, both sides could start general mobilisation. These are typically unpopular measures. For its part, Russia is likely waiting for the post-presidential election in March 2024 for this reason.\u00a0Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military is facing a recruiting crisis. It may soon have no choice but to turn to general mobilisation, no matter how hard they\u2019ve tried to protect their youngest male population. Russian and Ukrainian societies face different societal responses to general mobilisation. Ukraine has the advantage of high morale and a strong will to fight to defend its country, whereas Russian society, by and large, remains apathetic.Still, there are myriad other issues: attrition rates within each army, sizes of each army and country, ability to train and equip recruits, and overall demographic challenges are different in Russia and Ukraine. All these factors influence a potential outcome. Second, there has been ongoing fluidity along numerous fronts across multiple domains in Ukraine, and 2024 could see continuous escalation. Most recently, at the time of this writing, in December 2023, the Russians are pushing into Donetsk while the Ukrainians are across Dnipro.In early December, Ukrainian troops took positions on the east bank of the Dnipro River, posing a threat to Russia\u2019s dominance of the region.At the time of this writing, Ukrainians were operating in eastern Kherson Oblast, which previously experts said would be impossible. They also denied significant chunks of the Black Sea to the Russians, who, for their part, have been experiencing staggering personal and material losses in Avdiivka.It\u2019s too soon to tell what that may mean for a final outcome, but both sides are actively taking steps to change the current situation.Lastly, the Russians are doing so at a scale the Ukrainians are currently unable to match. Both tactical and long-range strategic drones will likely play a key role on the battlefield in 2024. If previously approximately 90% of Ukrainian wounds came from artillery, some suggest that it is now split approximately half and half between artillery and suicide drones.Last winter, Russia had targeted Ukraine\u2019s military and civilian infrastructure\u2014especially energy production capabilities\u2014but then shifted the strategic emphasis.The campaign back then was meant to break the will of the Ukrainian people to force a negotiated settlement on Russia\u2019s terms, but it did not work. The Russian military appears to be returning to this strategy this winter but with a new advantage. Western Support UncertainNo matter the will to fight and sustain losses, resources matter, especially as the Russian military continues to adapt.The future of US military aid currently hangs in the balance. Most recently, the US Senate blocked a $110.5bn aid package for Ukraine, Israel and American allies in the Pacific. If Congress and the Biden administration reach a compromise on immigration and border security issues, Ukraine will get the necessary aid.Most Senate Republicans still support aid to Ukraine, and theoretically, Congressional leaders could still sort this out. Still, a compromise on immigration has been a domestic challenge for the United States for well over a decade.Moreover, what seems to be lost on Congressional leaders is that the money spent on Ukraine is mainly for replacing military equipment.Congress is concerned that aid to Ukraine\u2014and Israel\u2014will impact US stocks necessary to preserve in case of a largely maritime war against China. However, in reality, by spending on Ukraine, the US is\u00a0revitalising and sustaining its own industrial base.Meanwhile, recent polls also show that domestic public support for Ukraine is beginning to wane, with some finding that almost half of Americans say the US is doing too much to help Ukraine. In contrast, others find that a slim majority still supports aid to Ukraine.\u00a0Moreover, the support shows a growing partisan divide, with a sharper decline in Republican support compared to that of Democrats.The Biden administration and the larger US foreign policy and academic communities have largely been unable to impart to the American public the imperative of supporting Ukraine\u2014why it matters to the American public and what costs it would bear if Ukraine does not win.But if Ukraine does not receive military assistance soon, it may find itself in something worse than a stalemate\u2014the scales would tip decisively in Russia\u2019s favour.It could turn into a scenario comparable to the Russo-Finnish War of 1939-1940, which resulted in the Finnish army\u2019s exhaustion as the country fought alone, without external support. Eventually, Finland conceded a loss and was forced into a peace treaty with Moscow.Still, Finland retained its sovereignty, even though it lost territory. Based on Putin\u2019s maximalist goals, this may not be possible in Ukraine\u2019s case.Potential for Expansion\u201cThere will only be\u00a0peace in Ukraine\u00a0when we achieve our\u00a0aims,\u201d Putin declared on 14 December last year, adding that these goals remain unchanged. He was speaking at the first news conference where Western media was allowed since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0Putin has no incentive to stop the war because the West hasn\u2019t outlined a coherent strategy and a defined outcome for Ukraine that includes the imposition of costs on Russia that outweigh the benefits of fighting.For the last two years, he has only doubled down on fighting. To better understand this, one must only look at Russia\u2019s growing strategic relationship with Iran and China, North Korea\u2019s shift toward Russia, and Russia\u2019s fingerprints on the increased escalation in conflict in Syria, between Israel and Hamas, and now in Venezuela.The war on Ukraine is not a local affair\u2014Putin has already shown he is doubling down around the globe. This year may see Russia meddling in a variety of ways and stoking regional crises todivert Western attention from Ukraine to realise Putin\u2019s goal of redefining the rules of the international order. Far from a stalemate, the war thus could expand vertically (in intensity), laterally (when it comes to domain) and horizontally (geographically).Against this backdrop, growing internal divisions in the West and a lack of resolve and strategic thinking to ensure Ukraine\u2019s victory may define 2024. It is unclear when and how the war will end. But it is certain that when it does, the outcome will play a crucial part in defining the world in which we live.Anna Borshchevskaya is a senior fellow in The Washington Institute\u2019s Diane and Guilford Glazer Foundation Program on Great Power Competition and the Middle East.

In this model-based scenario study, medium-term effects of the war are quantified on agricultural production, trade flows, market prices, food security, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions. The scenarios assess the possible consequences of macro-economic and agricultural production impacts in Ukraine, trade sanctions against Russia, and conflict-related energy price developments for global trade, food security, and greenhouse gas emissions. From a food security perspective, we conclude that there is enough food on the global level, but higher food and energy prices cause problems for low-income populations, spending a large part of their income on staple foods. Agricultural production and area expansion in parts of the world other than Ukraine and Russia could pose a risk to biodiversity and lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions related to land. However, total greenhouse gas emissions might decrease as lower emissions from less use of fossil energy due to higher energy and fertilizer prices in the whole economy dominate additional emissions resulting from land use change.Similar content being viewed by othersHigh energy and fertilizer prices are more damaging than food export curtailment from Ukraine and Russia for food prices, health and the environmentArticle23 December 2022Peter Alexander, Almut Arneth, \u2026 Mark D. A. RounsevellGlobal environmental impacts of food system from regional shock: Russia-Ukraine war as an exampleArticleOpen access31 January 2024Haoran Zhang, Limin Jiao, \u2026 Yuanchao HuLand-based climate change mitigation measures can affect agricultural markets and food securityArticle24 February 2022Shinichiro Fujimori, Wenchao Wu, \u2026 Kiyoshi TakahashiIntroductionThe Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, led to rapid and substantial price increases in international grain and oilseed markets and has increased acute food security concerns in many parts of the world1,2,3. Ukraine and Russia\u2014which together exported 28% of wheat, 16% of maize, 65% of sunflower oil, 23% of sunflower seed and 13% of rapeseed of the world volumes in 2020\u2014mainly supply low-income countries in the Middle East and Africa with these essential food commodities. Bread prices already rose sharply in the months after the start of the conflict in these import-dependent countries2,3. Energy and fertilizer prices, already rising before the start of the war, were further pushed up by the conflict, leading to higher agricultural production costs with possible consequences for harvests in the coming years. While many analyses of the impact of the conflict for food markets focus on short-term and net-import country specific effects4,5,6,7, on global effects of one commodity8, on various agricultural product9 or on longer term agricultural products10, none of the studies until now provides global longer-term economy-wide perspective of the Russian invasion into Ukraine. This becomes highly relevant as evidently the conflict still continues, and insights are needed into what extent this war will affect global food security and related climate and environmental consequences for years to come.This study addresses these issues by simulating medium-term impact of the conflict \u2013 i.e. two years after Russia\u2019s invasion into Ukraine on the 24th of February in 2022. The contribution of this study is that it incorporates circular flows of income and expenditures which are important from a food access perspective. Most model-based studies on food security impacts report only food availability11, but food security is a much more complicated issue, and understanding its future requires insights into income distribution, purchasing power, political processes, and institutional changett12,13. In this study we include food access, which is highly relevant to the expected price increases due to supply constraints due to the war. For access to food both income and expenditures of various labour types are important, and especially the income side is ignored in studies evaluating the impacts of the conflict on food markets to date.In addition, we add an integrated land-food-fertilizer-energy perspective which is important to cover relations between agricultural and energy sectors. The consequences of negative production shocks in Ukraine and Russia are transmitted through trade relations around the world and are central to our analyses. Fertilizers are energy intensive and a key input for agriculture. Given that Russia is an important exporter of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) fertilizers14, fertilizers play a pivotal role in channeling the impacts of the war across the world. By capturing the land-food-fertilizer-energy nexus, this study provides an economy-wide perspective on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions coming from land use expansion and other sources, such as energy savings and substituting fossil-based by renewable energy sources. Agricultural land use expansion is also a key driver of biodiversity15. It is thus possible to evaluate potential trade-offs between food security and environment provoked by the Ukraine-Russia conflict and obtain a holistic picture of its impacts.Where most previous studies are based on expert judgments, sector-specific or country models, this study uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, that allows us to consider economic and environmental impacts of the conflict in an economy-wide analysis framework. The application of CGE models to analyse to medium-term economic shocks has also been used in case of the Covid-19 pandemics16,17,18,19,20,21). In this study, we use the agricultural and bioeconomy focused Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET) model that integrates the food, fertilizer and energy markets on a global scale, embeds bilateral trade-flows and includes circular flows of income and expenditures for various labour types22,23,24. The model explicitly represents N, P and K next to detailed agricultural and energy markets25 and it is characterised by segmented labour markets between agricultural and non-agricultural markets acknowledging that workers in agriculture cannot easily move to find a job outside agriculture. Food availability, which includes all domestically produced and imported food available for consumption at household level, is measured in kcal per capita per day26,27,28. Food access relates to people\u2019s food purchasing power and therefore to food prices, dietary patterns, and income developments28. This study uses the \u2018food purchasing power\u2019 indicator, by relating price developments of a specific food consumption basket to income developments of a particular income group.Furthermore, we determine environmental impacts by looking at agricultural land use and GHG emissions. Agricultural land use is an important environmental indicator as land use expansion for agriculture may lead to deforestation, forest degradation and concurrent losses in carbon stock and biodiversity15. GHG emissions are influenced by the war in various ways as on the one hand land use expansion in other parts of the world might lead to higher emissions as carbon is released into the air and on the other side higher energy and fertiliser prices lead to energy savings and substitution away from fossils fuels to renewable energy sources, and therefore to lower GHG emissions. While agricultural focused studies9,10 include the agricultural land use related emissions, such studies ignore the potential saved GHG emissions in the rest of the economy due to higher energy prices.Based on a scenario-analysis this study estimates the possible medium-term effects (i.e., effects for the next two years) of the war on agricultural production, trade flows, market prices, food security, land use and GHG emissions at national levels, presenting impacts on different regions of the world and in some low-income countries that are heavily dependent on wheat, other grain and oilseed imports.Ukraine conflict\u2019s contribution to food securityIn this study we formulate seven scenarios to estimate the impact of the war between Russia and Ukraine on international food markets. Each of these scenarios consists of assumptions, some of which reflect consequences of trade sanctions against Russia already announced by Western countries in the first months after the start of the war. Note that our assumptions about expected impacts on the economy and agricultural production in Ukraine and Russia are based on sources available up to June 2022.The scenarios are divided into three blocks to distinguish between:1.The effects of the war in Ukraine resulting from a trade blockade between Ukraine on the one hand and Russia and Belarus on the other, extended to lower GDP and reduced agricultural production in Ukraine, and higher trade costs for exports from this country;2.The economic impact of Western countries trade sanctions against Russia, lower GDP in and potentially reduced trade by Russia in cereals and oilseeds due to productivity decline and logistical problems;3.The effects of a global increase in energy prices, since the day of invasion.All scenarios are constructed in order, with each scenario retaining the assumptions of the previous scenario and then adding further assumptions to this scenario. By doing this, we isolate the impact of each set of model shocks and assumptions under (1), (2), and (3). This allows us to identify the largest impact on world food market prices and food security indicators. Firstly, this is true only of the aspects tested in the scenarios. Secondly, to determine which aspects are more important they need to be tested in isolation, as interaction effects could be important in the outcomes that are confounding with this additive approach. We did run all shocks in isolation and a comparison with the additive results show that the interaction effects are limited and therefore our additive results are a good indication of the importance of the shocks (see, Supplementary Methods, section additive versus isolated scenario set-up). The scenarios and their implementation are summarized in Table\u00a01. A more elaborate description is given in the Method section and in the Supplementary Methods (Scenario set-up).Table. 1 Scenario description, assumptions and implementation.Full size tableFor the macroeconomic impacts, such as the expected negative impact on GDP for Ukraine and Russia, we rely on expectations based on OECD29, IMF30 and World Bank31. Sanctions and other trade impacts are achieved by introducing tariffs between the countries. Energy prices have risen sharply since June 2020 (Fig.\u00a01), when the demand for energy fell sharply due to economic downturn due to strict covid measures. Energy prices increased in 2021 as the economy picked up after easing of covid measures and low stocks and deliberate policies by providers to keep prices at the same level kept supply tight (IEA report July and November 2021). Whether energy prices also increased in the months leading up to February 2022 due to the mounting military tension between Russia and Ukraine is plausible, but not identified as one of the factors that materially determined international energy prices according to IEA reports from 2021.Fig. 1: Development of world energy prices (Crude Oil Brent).The Brent Crude oil price (USD/Bbl) is a major benchmark price for purchases of oil worldwide. Source: https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/brent-crude-oil.Full size imageOn the eve of the invasion day Brent crude oil was traded at US$92/Bbl. In the first month after the start of the war, oil prices peaked at US$127/Bbl only to fall again somewhat afterwards to stabilize around US$ 110/Bbl in June 202232. The latter implies a 20% increase in energy price since the eve of invasion day. This number is used in our energy price impact scenario as a proxy for the energy price increase due to the war, although also other factors might have contributed in this period. As we focus on the impact of war itself, we do not include the increase in energy prices before the war in our impact analyses but the level at the day before the invasion is our starting point. As part of the energy price increase before the war might be due to Russia military tension, we performed a sensitivity analysis with the oil price of half a year before the start of the war (US$76/Bbl, 24 august). The implied energy price doubles then to about 40% between 24th of August in 2021 and 17th of June in 2022). The results of this \u2018double energy\u2019 sensitivity analyses are described in the article and all the detailed quantitative results and graphs are embedded in the Supplementary Methods (results of high energy price sensitivity scenario).We report model results on the impact of the scenarios on GDP, agricultural production, food exports and imports, world market prices, two food security indicators: food availability and food access, and two environmental indicators; land use change and GHG emissions. Results are presented for Ukraine, Russia and several countries that rely heavily on grain imports from Ukraine, Russia or both.ResultsOverall economic impactDue to the war GDP falls substantially in Ukraine and Russia, by 33% and 11% respectively in the period 2022-2024, but is limited in other countries (see, SI section additional results, Figure\u00a0S3). Outside Ukraine and Russia, the impact on GDP is the strongest in Central Asia (\u22120.5%), a region of countries with strong trade ties with Russia. The increase in energy prices contained in Scenario 3 has the largest impact on the fall in GDP in all regions.Impact on productionFigure\u00a02 shows that in scenario 3 the decline in production in Ukraine and Russia is partly offset by additional supply from other regions, where production adjusts in response to higher world market prices. Production increases in other regions between 1% in Asia & Oceania to 11% in the rest of Africa. Most regions increase their production around 5% (EU, North America, Middle and South America, Middle East) to 7%-8% (Central Asia, North Africa). In scenario 1 and 2 world production of oilseeds and other grains falls slightly and that of wheat remains stable as relatively high wheat prices attract resources from other sectors. In scenario 3 that includes higher energy prices the production of oilseeds (especially in Rest of South and Southeast Asia, Asia and Oceania, and Middle and South America) even rises slightly due to additional demand for non-food applications such as biofuels. In scenario 1, production of wheat and other cereals increases in various regions of the world and slightly in Russia. Oilseed production grows mainly in Central and South America. If Russian effects are also included (Scenario 2), wheat production in Russia decreases substantially and production increases mainly in Central Asia, in addition to the regions where production also increases in the Ukraine effect scenario (scenarios 1 and 2 are depicted in SI section additional results, Figure\u00a0S7 and Figure\u00a0S8). The impact of the double energy price sensitivity scenario on production developments is limited, and only oilseed production is a bit higher due to increased demand from biofuels (See, Figure\u00a0S14 in SI).Fig. 2: Production volume developments.Production volume developments in percentage change (%) and in absolute change (million US Dollars) for wheat, oilseeds, and other cereals in the \u2018Ukraine, Russia, energy price impacts\u2019 scenario (scenario 3). Source: MAGNET results (data behind graphs are available in Supplementary Data\u00a01).Full size imageImpact on world market pricesInternational price impacts for primary products show a substantial rise of wheat, other cereals (including maize) and oilseeds prices, of respectively 9.2%, 8.4%, and 5.0% (Fig.\u00a03). This is due to several reasons. First, Ukraine\u2019s production fall in Ukraine impacts scenario leads to a substantial decline of the country\u2019s exports of wheat and other grains (i.e., maize), which impact world markets through its weighty global role of exporter of these commodities. Due to this decrease in Ukraine production and exports of wheat and other grains, world prices increase by, respectively, 2% and 4% (see Fig.\u00a03, light blue bars). Oilseeds prices increase slightly less (1%) as Ukraine\u2019s share in world exports (of this product category) is less than for wheat and maize. Hereby, we have to remark that this is an aggregated category including key products for Ukraine such as sunflower seeds and oilseeds and less important products for Ukraine as soybean. The price effects for a specific product like sunflower seeds where Ukraine has a high market share will be higher. Second, Russia\u2019s decline of wheat, other grains, and oilseeds exports further exacerbates the impact on world market prices. Due to the Russia related shocks (scenario 2) wheat world prices are rising additionally by 4% and other grains world prices by an additional 1%. In both scenarios the prices of other crops increase as well due to higher production factor prices as the production of wheat and other grains in other countries (than Ukraine and Russia) expands. Especially land prices rise due to increased cereal production and demand for land. Third, increased energy prices (following the assumed 20% higher prices for coal, oil, and gas) in scenario 3 have a substantial impact on food prices; this scenario 3 adds 3-4%-points to global price increases for cereals and oilseeds. This is caused by higher energy and fertiliser cost in food production (production cost effect) and due to increased demand for biobased products (demand effect) for energy purposes, as the competitiveness of bio-based substitutes increases due to higher fossil energy prices. In the double energy price sensitivity scenario, wheat prices increase with an additional 3% to 11% and oilseeds and other cereals (including maize) increase with an additional 2.5% to 8%, and 12% respectively (See, Figure\u00a0S15, in SI). The latter increase is higher as it includes additional biofuel demand.Fig. 3: Development of world crop and fertiliser prices.World crop and fertiliser prices developments (% change) in the \u2018Ukraine impacts\u2019, \u2018Ukraine + Russia impacts\u2019, and the \u2018Ukraine, Russia, energy prices impacts\u2019 scenarios. Source: MAGNET results.Full size imageFertiliser price effects show to be strongly affected by our assumed energy price increase (implemented as an exogenous shock to the model). Fertiliser prices increase especially due to higher energy prices in scenario 3. Nitrogen prices increase a lot as the production process uses a lot of gas. When gas prices increase by 20%, the fertiliser (nitrogen) prices go up by almost 14%. The increase in phosphorous and potassium prices are more modest with about 4% in scenario 3. In the double energy price scenario nitrogen prices almost double from 14% to 27% (See, Figure\u00a0S15, in SI).Impact on food availabilityFood availability is decreasing in most low-income countries due to less supply from Ukraine and Russia (Fig.\u00a04). The impact is the largest in Egypt, Turkey and the Middle East, as these regions rely heavily on imports from Ukraine and Russia. Russian export reductions on top of Ukraine\u2019s reduced production and exports (scenario 2) greatly reduce the substitution and adjustment possibilities of import-dependent countries, with major consequences for food availability in these countries. Food availability in Europe has changed marginally. In the Ukraine effect scenario 1, food availability decreases by 0.2% and by 0.3% in scenario 2. Food availability does not change in the double energy price sensitivity scenario for the rest of the world (See, Figure\u00a0S16, in SI), except that it improves slightly for oil producing countries (Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria)) and worsens a bit for South Africa and South and South-East Asia.Fig. 4: Food availability developments.Food availability, which includes all domestically produced and imported food available for consumption at household level, is measured in kcal per capita per day, and depicted for the \u2018Ukraine impacts\u2019, \u2018Ukraine + Russia impacts\u2019, and \u2018Ukraine-Russia-energy price impacts\u2019 scenario. Source: MAGNET results.Full size imageImpact on food accessAccess to food (represented by a food purchasing power index) deteriorates by about 3\u20137% (Egypt, Turkey and Rest Central Asia) in most low- and middle-income countries in the Ukraine-Russia-energy prices scenario (Scen 3) (See lower panel, Fig.\u00a05). Cereal diet prices go up by 5\u201310% and increase more than the wages of unskilled workers as they remain constant (Turkey, South Africa) or increase up to 4% (Egypt, Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa). Wages in Egypt, Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) go up due to increased (oil) revenues due to higher energy prices (Nigeria is part of SSA). Higher food prices for cereals are the main reason for a substantial decrease in access to food in case poor people\u2019s diet consists mainly of cereals. World market price increases for wheat and other cereals are directly translated into reduced access to food, since the wages of unskilled people increase less than cereal prices. For consumers who have a more varied diet with fewer cereals, whose prices are rising the most, the impact on food access is smaller. For the EU, for example, cereal prices rise by 4% and, given the relatively low proportion of income spent on food, this should not be a problem for the average citizen. However, higher food prices in combination with higher energy prices may reduce access to food for some low-income groups in the EU. In the double energy price scenario, the food purchasing power index deteriorates close to 10% for many countries due to the higher increase in cereal prices and the relatively unchanged unskilled wages in agriculture (See, Figure\u00a0S17, in SI).Fig. 5: Food access developments.Food access is measured by a food purchasing power index based on a cereal diet (including paddy rice, wheat and \u2018other grains\u2019) for unskilled (production) workers in the agricultural sector.

Source: MAGNET results.Full size imageImpact on environment: Land use and GHG emissionsImpact on Agricultural land useLand use is an important indicator of environmental impact. In the Ukraine impact scenario production declines in Ukraine cause agricultural land use to expand in the rest of the world with 6.2\u2009Mha. The expansion is due to higher agricultural prices which induce higher production and therefore higher demand for land. Depending on the scarcity of land in a region this leads to higher land prices and\\or land use expansion. Higher land use prices induce substitution effects away from land using more labour and capital and thereby increasing the yields (See, methodological section and Supplementary Methods (Model definition)). The land expansion is therefore highest in Middle and South America and in Rest of Africa where land area expansion possibilities still exist. In the Ukraine-Russia impact scenario land use in Russia decreases (8\u2009Mha) and it expands in Middle and South America (3.5\u2009Mha) and Rest of Africa (2.3\u2009Mha) with an overall (net) increase of 2\u2009Mha at world level. With higher energy prices (the third scenario) land use expansion is higher in all regions leading to an expansion of 6.6\u2009Mha at world level. This increase in global agricultural land use is a bit lower than the findings of 11\u2009Mha of Carriquiry et al.9, but much lower than the 227Mha increase in the Alexander et al.10 study. The latter study uses much higher energy and fertilizer shocks as their analyses covers a longer period and includes the substantial energy price increases in the period before the war. A key driver for agricultural land use expansion is that higher energy prices lead to higher fertiliser prices (See, Fig.\u00a03) and therefore less fertiliser use, which leads to lower yields and an upward pressure for land demand. Additionally, there is greater incentive for bio-energy sources to replace fossil fuels which further drives demand for agricultural land. As land use is one of the main indicators of biodiversity and land use expansion for agriculture in general has a negative impact on biodiversity, the Ukraine war increases risk for biodiversity loss15. Global agricultural land use increases with 3Mha in the double energy price sensitivity scenario to 10Mha, as especially agricultural land uses expand a bit more in Middle and South America from 5Mha to 6Mha (See, Figure\u00a0S18, in SI).Impact on GHG emissionsRegarding the GHG emissions we separate the change in emissions related to land use change from all other sources included in our modeling framework as agricultural land use expansion in other parts of the world (see Fig.\u00a06) is the key source of increasing emissions in previous studies. Land use emissions in the \u2018Ukraine impacts\u2019 and the \u2018Ukraine+Russia impacts\u2019 scenario increase with 0.6 Gt CO2e and 0.2 Gt CO2e, respectively (Fig.\u00a07, dark blue bars). The total 6.6Mha global land use expansion in the \u2018Ukraine, Russia, energy price\u2019 scenario (Fig.\u00a06) leads to a substantial increase in land use related emissions of 0.6 Gt CO2e which is lower than the 1.0 GT CO2e result in Carriquiry et al.9.Fig. 6: Agricultural land use developments.Global and regional agricultural land use developments (absolute changes in ha) in the \u2018Ukraine impacts\u2019, \u2018Ukraine + Russia impacts\u2019, and the \u2018Ukraine, Russia, energy prices impacts\u2019 scenarios. Source: MAGNET results.Full size imageFig. 7: Developments of GHG emissions.Developments of regional and global GHG emissions due to land use change (dark blue) and all other sources, such as changes in fossil energy use and animal production (light blue), in Mton CO2-equivalent. Source: MAGNET results.Full size imageThe economy-wide modeling framework embeds various GHG emissions such as fossil energy related CO2 emissions in all sectors of the economy and methane (CH4) emissions related to, for example, animal and rice production (see, methodological section and the Supplementary Methods (Model definition)). Figure\u00a07 illustrates that these emissions (light blue bars) are slightly negative in the \u2018Ukraine impacts\u2019 and the \u2018Ukraine+Russia impacts\u2019 scenario due to especially lower animal production. Overall, the total emissions go up in these scenarios, as the increase in agricultural land use related emissions is higher. In the \u2018Ukraine, Russia, energy price\u2019 scenario the higher energy prices lead to substitution away from fossil energy sources and to less demand for fossil energy intensive products due to relatively large price increases of these products. Figure\u00a07 shows that therefore in the \u2018Ukraine, Russia, energy price\u2019 scenario\u2019 these GHG emissions decrease in all regions, and especially Asia and Oceania, which include China. Higher fossil energy prices reduce GHG emissions with 1.6 GT CO2e at the global level. The reduction is by two thirds caused by lower emissions in the production and one third by lower emissions in the consumption of commodities. The lower production emissions of 1.1 GT CO2e are achieved in the fossil energy sectors (0.62 GT CO2e), transport (0.45 GT CO2e) and manufacturing (0.04 GT CO2e). On the consumption side, the consumption of gas is especially reduced by 11%. Overall, the total GHG emissions decline in this scenario as GHG savings 1.6Gt CO2e are higher than the additional land use related emissions of 0.6 GT CO2e. This is true for almost all regions except for South America and Rest Africa where land use related GHG emissions still dominate the other emissions. The land use related emissions are also higher than in other scenarios in South America as the higher energy prices lead to an increased demand for biofuels and therefore land use expansion. In the double energy price scenario land use related emissions increase from 0.6 GT CO2e to 0.9 GT CO2e and other GHG emissions decrease from \u22121.5 Gt CO2e to \u22122.9 Gt CO2e leading almost to a doubling of the decrease in GHG emissions from 1 GT CO2e to 2 GTCO2e (See, Figure\u00a0S19, in SI).DiscussionThe absolute number of hungry and poor people (around 720\u2013811 million people) has increased globally since 199033,34. War and conflicts are the main drivers of food insecurity and hunger in the world35. Two thirds of people that are acutely food insecure are living in 23 countries where war and conflicts were the main reason for food insecurity34. They also estimate that, therefore, 47 countries are expected not to reach the United Nations zero hunger goal33. The Russia-Ukraine war drove up the already high food prices, which were mainly driven by growth in population, income, and COVID (FAO36). Higher food prices reduce food affordability and real income and can have severe implications on food security.This study shows that the Ukraine-Russian conflict does not threaten food availability on the global level. The study emphasizes the global response of production and use and their impact on international grain and oilseeds markets as a result of the war. The strong decline in production and exports of grain and oilseeds in Ukraine and the decline in exports from Russia are largely offset by growing production elsewhere in the world and by substitution of wheat and other cereals with other food and feed products. However, net importing countries, especially those relying heavily on grain and/or oilseed imports from one or both warring countries, will pay more for imports, putting pressure on food availability and food access, especially for the poorest part of the population. These outcomes are dependent on assumptions in the model and on the scenario in which the course of the war and therefore its consequences for the food markets are highly uncertain. Uncertainties are the length of the war, the part of production that is affected by the war and whether production can still be exported from Russia and Ukraine. Should the war situation continue, the consequences for the international food markets could be greater, although also larger production responses will be observed in the rest of the world. The estimated price impact (8%) for wheat is at the lower end of the price range estimated by FAO14 in which wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia fall by 25 million tons per year, other grains by 5 million tons and oilseeds by 3 million tons. The FAO scenario leads to 8\u201322% higher food and feed prices in the short term (in 2022/23 compared to baseline) and after five years (2026/27) to 10\u201319% higher wheat prices compared to baseline. Mottaleb et al.8 estimate that 50% reduction of Russia and Ukraine wheat exports could increase domestic prices by 15%. Carriquiry et al.9 find that reduced exports and production increase wheat prices by 7%. Our global price results are at the low end of these findings, and this can be explained by our longer period and because our CGE analyses allow for more substitution possibilities on the production and consumption side25. Furthermore, Ukraine and Russia are both important suppliers and exporters of fertilisers (potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen)14,25. The high fertiliser prices (14% up in case of nitrogen) caused by higher energy prices put more pressure on the food markets as nitrogen is an important source for high yields (essential for high protein wheat and therefore bread). Higher energy prices of 40% instead of 20% do not have a large effect on agricultural production, but induce especially higher fertilizer and food prices, which have especially a negative effect on food access and land use expansion.With regard to the effects of the war on international food market prices, it should be borne in mind that prices of major food commodities already showed an upward trend in the course of 2020, which continued in 2021 (see also FAO34). The increase of international food prices was mostly due to market conditions but also due to the high prices of energy, fertilizers and other agricultural inputs and services caused by an increase in demand resulting from recovery plans aimed at countering the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic14. The consequences of the war for prices on the international food markets, as they manifested themselves in the first months after the Russian invasion, thus came on top of the historically relatively high price levels. World food prices appear to have peaked in late May 2022, when international prices for wheat and other key food commodities fell due to good summer harvests in some key grain-producing countries (Canada, Australia), followed by the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which in part has resumed exports through Ukrainian ports from August 2022. While this initiative is a positive development, the situation in Ukraine and the status of agricultural exports remains uncertain. Carriquiry et al.9 stress that the attack on the port of Odesa or, potentially, mines in the Black Sea have made grain shipments expensive and far below normal (less than 0.4Mt). In addition, countries (such as India for wheat and Indonesia for palm oil) have lifted export restrictions they had previously imposed in an attempt to stabilize their domestic price levels in response to rising international prices (for an analysis of these export restrictions on the international market37). Thus, market and policy responses have contributed to the drop in international prices in June-August 2022 and thereby easing pressures on global food security.Countries highly dependent on grain imports such as Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Sudan, and Tunisia have limited possibilities to expand wheat production due to the often short and (too) dry growing seasons and the limited water availability in these countries. Irrigated cultivation, preferably in combination with drought-resistant seeds, can boost production38,39,40, but requires quite a bit of investment that, if made at all, may only contribute to a greater degree of self-sufficiency in the longer term. For the time being, these countries will therefore remain dependent on imports and price fluctuations on the international markets will feed through to domestic food prices.Countries such as Egypt, Turkey and those in the Middle East may have the institutions, capabilities and financial resources to access global supply sources other than Russia and/or Ukraine to stabilize domestic prices, but remain vulnerable to price increases on international markets if, at the same time, their own currencies depreciate against the dollar; this is what has happened in recent years in among others Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey and what has happened in the first half of 2022 too. The food security of import-dependent countries is therefore determined, in addition to price fluctuations on the world market, by the weak competitive position of a country, which is reflected in the development of its currency exchange rate.In line with studies that investigate environmental effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, this article confirms that global agricultural land use expansion leads to more GHG emissions (0.6GT CO2e), which is expected to increase the risk for biodiversity loss. Our economy wide study, in contrast to studies that focus on the agricultural sector only, enables also to calculate the GHG impact on the rest of the economy (1.6Gt CO2e); this is relevant as higher fossil energy prices are likely to induce substitution effects towards renewable energy and using energy saving technologies. Our results show that the overall impact on GHG emissions of the war is positive as overall GHG emissions decrease with 1 GT CO2e in the 20% energy price increase scenario and with 2 GT CO2e in the 40% energy price increase scenario. As global GHG emissions were about 36.8 GT CO2e41, the GHG savings are 4% in the 20% energy price scenario due to less use of fossil energy and 2.5% overall reduction including the higher land use emissions. This might be seen as considerable given empirical evidence in the past42. However, IEA41 states that CO2 growth in 2022 was well below global GDP growth of 3.2% and equal to 0.9%. Energy price shocks and disruptions to traditional fuel trade flows were identified by IEA as key drivers for this result and increased deployment of clean energy technologies helped prevent an additional 550 Mt in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, industrial production curtailment, particularly in China and Europe, also averted additional emissions41. These findings are in line with our scenario results, given that in this paper we use a comparative static analysis for the war specific shocks and do not include the overall economic GDP growth of 3.2%. The scenario results indicate, for example, that the GHG emissions decline relative to GDP, renewables contribute to the decrease in emissions, and emissions will be lower in especially China (Asia & Oceania) and EU. We find also that different substitution elasticities in the energy sector and different energy prices both affect the land use and the fossil related emissions in a broadly similar order of magnitude. Therefore, we argue that our finding that the increase in land use emissions is lower than the decrease in emissions associated with reduced fossil fuel use is not very dependent on these substitution elasticities and energy price uncertainties.On Policy recommendations: The findings of this study warn the consequences of the ongoing armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine including reduced food affordability. Given the already high number of acute food insecure countries these developments worsen the situation in especially wheat and other cereals, importing countries and lead to violence and social unrest, as was the case during the 2005-2007 food crises35. In the short-run international donor organizations should provide affordable substitutes for wheat and other cereals in poor import-dependent countries. In the longer term, net grain-importing countries need to build resilience to mitigate the effects of subsequent international market disruptions. Policy measures to consider are, for instance, (increased) investment in roads and other market infrastructure (to reduce transaction costs and improve the functioning and efficiency of markets), and additional research and expansion efforts to increase the production of (drought-resistant) alternatives to wheat production to build resilience through diversification of their agricultural production portfolio. Market prices should guide production decisions in wheat exporting countries (e.g., China, India, USA, Canada, France, Argentina, Pakistan, Germany). Regarding food access income support or food safety nets might increase the food purchasing power of consumers. In many developed countries consumers are compensated for higher energy and food prices. This is not the case in many developing countries, where food access problems are most severe, as income support has large government budgetary consequences. For national governments and international donors\u2019 social security programs are essential policy tools to support poor people in food insecure countries.An important insight has been with respect to the trade-offs between food security, climate change and biodiversity. The war conflict influences primarily negatively food security, but it also has potential negative consequences on biodiversity. The impacts are however geographically heterogenous, while in case of food security, food net-importing countries are affected the most (e.g. Egypt, Middle East and Turkey), in case biodiversity, these are the land-abundant countries where production potential exists to compensate for food shortages on the international markets (e.g. Latin America). Different regions of the world are thus expected to suffer with different sorts of impacts (high social unrest vs biodiversity related risks). From the climate perspective the war conflict could be seen as stimulator of green transition and climate change mitigation. It is also apparent that using more biobased mitigation options to replace fossil energy based options leads to land use expansion and can therefore increase the risk for biodiversity loss43. To prevent a higher risk for biodiversity loss land use conservation management will be important but this will creates pressure for food15. All these trade-offs should be considered when assessing the impacts of economic shocks in general. Therefore, carefully selected policy bundles will be required to meet various policy targets.Limitations: This study presents plausible ranges from Ukraine, Russia and energy prices impacts to give sense of production, price and food security impacts given the unknown outcome and end of war. Our analysis is not a short-term analysis but focusses on the medium term. The application of CGE methodology to analyze the impact of economic shocks provides several valuable insights but it also comes with a caveat as it assumes that markets have found a new equilibrium based on rational behaviour of all agents. It could be argued that in the short term, people do not behave rationally, and it is not easy to substitute produce from one region to another or shift cultivation from one crop to another but in the longer term this is possible. Therefore, the results thus indicate more permanent impacts after the initial deviations from equilibrium are resolved, and do not mimic short run developments. More short run developments are discussed in Carriquiry, et al.9 and Alexander et al.10. We assume that countries can respond given normal circumstances, but they might be constrained due to, for example, droughts as happened last year in South America. In case of droughts in major producing countries the increase in food prices will be higher. Regarding the assumptions we used crude oil prices as the point of reference and these analyses could be enhanced by taking additional assumptions on, for example, gas prices as these are important for fertilizers. With regard to the latter, a challenge is that gas price developments are much more local and dependent on local country specific (tax) arrangements. Food security is a complicated issue and although we include food access or food affordability, the other two dimensions of food security, within the FAO definition44,45, food utilization and food stability are not covered in this modeling study. For the food utilisation dimension the explicit modelling of micro and macronutrients at household level is needed in combination with clear guidelines of healthy diets. To better address food access, an explicit household dimension, covering both income and food expenditures at specific household level, is needed within the modelling framework. This provides insight into the distribution of food access among specific households, as more aggregated households might hide food access problems for specific households and therefore our analyses might understate its prevalence. Combining CGE analyses with household level micro-simulation models could enhance these analyses. To enhance the environmental impact linkages with spatial explicit land use models and specialized biodiversity models would provide more accurate and a broader range of results10,15. However, as land use expansion is a key driver in biodiversity model the impact of the war on biodiversity will likely remain negative. To better understand the impacts of the war it is important to complement this study with indebt country case studies. In the CGE analyses we were limited in this regard as some food insecure and import-dependent countries in the Middle East and Africa are aggregated into regional groups. Country studies5,6,7 enrich the impacts of the Ukraine war and enable extra and distinct perspectives.MethodsThe Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET) model is a multiregional, multisectoral, applied general equilibrium model based on neoclassical microeconomic theory with a focus on the bioeconomy22,24. It is an extended version of the standard Global Trade analyses Project (GTAP) model46. A distinguishing feature of MAGNET is its modular structure, allowing the model to be easily tailored to specific research questions, regions, and products of interest. As a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model MAGNET covers the entire global economy, with extensions adding detail on food and biomass production and use not available from other CGE models. The core of MAGNET is an input\u2013output model, which links industries in value-added chains from primary goods, over continuously higher stages of intermediate processing, to the final assembly of goods and services for consumption. Primary production factors are employed within each economic region, and hence returns to land and capital are endogenously determined at equilibrium, that is, the aggregate supply of each factor equals its demand. On the consumption side, the regional household is assumed to distribute income across savings and (government and private) consumption expenditures according to fixed budget shares. Private consumption expenditures are allocated across commodities according to a non-homothetic constant difference of elasticity expenditure function, and government consumption according to Cobb\u2013the Douglas expenditure function. Modules relevant for the current study are the flexible nested constant elasticities of substitution (CES) production trees (allowing for more substitution possibilities than in the standard GTAP model, for example, energy sources and animal feed components). A key component for this Ukraine study is the treatment of land markets. Land supply is endogenous and allows land areas to expand and contract depending on demand and scarcity of the land endowment47. In land abundant countries (e.g. Middle and South America) additional demand leads especially to land use expansion while in land scarce countries additional demand leads to higher land prices (See, Supplementary Methods (Model definition)). On the land demand side, land heterogeneity is introduced by flexible nested Constant Elasticities of Transformation (CET) land allocation functions govern the movement of sluggish land across sectors depending on the ease of switching between different types of land use.The MAGNET flexible production tree set up enables a modified treatment of energy demand, energy-capital and inter-fuel substitution, carbon dioxide accounting and taxation, since it has been specifically designed to be used in the context of greenhouse gases (GHG) mitigation policies48,49,50,51. Energy inputs are combined with capital to produce an energy-capital composite; the latter is combined with other primary inputs in a value-added-energy composite. Energy use is split into fossil-based energy (gas, coal and nuclear) and fossil-based heat on the one side and renewable energy (wind, hydro and biomass) and bio heat on the other side. The detailed sector information for both electricity and heat enables a transition from fossil based to renewable (bio)economy. First and second-generation biofuels for road transport and aviation biofuels, biochemicals (bio plastics, bio pharmaceutical and biochemicals and innovative sectors like pe and pla bioplastic sectors) are introduced into the model, along with their directive targets for blending with fossil fuels23,52. An emissions module calculates emissions of GHG gases \u2013 CO2, N2O and CH4. Both combustion and non-combustion emissions are included in this accounting. Emissions can be tracked by gas type, fuel type, emitting sector and region. In addition to accounting for emissions, carbon taxes and marginal abatement curves (the possibility of switching to a lower emission intensity (if such option is technically feasible) because of e.g. carbon taxes). Land use expansion emissions are calculated based on mean carbon coefficients from Carriquiry et al.9 which implies that the additional 0.09 Gt CO2e per Mha.The \u2018food purchasing power\u2019 indicator, is calculated by relating price developments of a specific food consumption basket to income developments of a particular income group. We define (%) changes in food purchasing power as % change in income of specific income group minus % change in the price of a food basket. For the food basket, consumption of cereals (including paddy rice, wheat and \u2018other grains\u2019) is used as a proxy for the diet of less wealthy people, as rice is an important food component for poor people in Asia, while grains are important in Africa24. Changes in the wages of unskilled (production) workers in the agricultural sector are used as a proxy for the income component of poor people.Other features are a purchasing power adjusted constant difference of elasticity (CDE) demand function (adjusting income elasticities in baseline projections to attain a more plausible pattern in food demand when incomes rise substantially), and segmentation and imperfect mobility between agriculture and non-agriculture labour and capital are introduced in the modelling of factors markets (capturing diverging labour and capital price developments in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors). As MAGNET, like many other CGE models, in its default setting is specified for a medium-term impact (around five year) to long term impact. The default setting is reflected in various model specifications including parameterizations. To enable the model suitable for capturing certain short to medium term responses, we have made certain changes in the model settings. We add rigidity to the production system to as the requested time frame of two years is shorter than the normally considered adjustment period within this kind of analysis, by reducing the standard substitution elasticities between production factors by 50% relative to the level of the original GTAP and MAGNET elasticities (especially substitution elasticities between inputs in the production of agricultural, food and energy industries, including the substitution elasticities between fossil and renewable energy sources for electricity production).Scenario set-upWe estimate the impacts of the Russian-Ukraine conflict on international food markets by incorporating assumptions into a scenario in which we match some already known consequences of the conflict such as trade restrictions and sanctions that were announced by the EU and US in March and April 2022. We build up the scenario in three blocks, in which we distinguish between (1) the effects of the conflict in Ukraine that arise from a trade stop between Ukraine on the one hand and Russia and Belarus on the other, extended with lower GDP and reduced agricultural production in Ukraine, and increasing trade cost for exports from the country (2) economic impacts of sanctions against Russia, resulting in lower GDP of and reduced trade by Russia in cereals and oilseeds, and (3) effects of a global energy price increase. All the scenarios build upon each other, by including all elements of the previous scenario and at the end representing the whole impact. In this way we can assess the contribution of the various assumptions on the world markets and prices and assess which part of the storyline will have the greatest impact on global food market prices and food security indicators. The three scenario building blocks are the following.1.Impacts in Ukraine on GDP, agricultural production, and trade costs. Scenario 1a is a \u2018Trade stop between Ukraine and Russia & Belarus\u2019 and is a starting point is the assumption that in the coming years there will be no or only very limited trade between Ukraine on the one hand, and Russia and Belarus on the other, due to current hostilities and the mutual animosity between the countries that may persist for years to come. Scenario 1b extends scenario 1a with \u2018Production and GDP loss within Ukraine\u2019. The war in Ukraine displaced a third of the country\u2019s population from their homes, of which approximately 4\u2009m (around 10% of the total population) fled abroad. In addition, many buildings and an important part of the infrastructure were damaged. Economic activities continue to come to a standstill in large parts of the country due to the constant threat of war for the time being. This has major consequences for the country\u2019s output levels and income-generating opportunities. We assume the direct economic impacts of the conflict are caused by a 30% decline in labour and capital endowments, which results in a substantial GDP fall. Agricultural production in Ukraine suffers in the short term from the war situation due to insecurity in the countryside, lack of inputs and working capital, and a shortage of labour. By 1 April, analysts estimate the number of areas with spring-planted grains and oilseeds will be so much less than in 2021 that the estimated total production of grains and oilseeds in 2022 is expected to be 50% lower than the record level of the previous season53. Due to war damage and expected ongoing difficulties in obtaining sufficient inputs, it is likely that agricultural production will continue to be substantially less than in \u2018normal\u2019 years for the time being. We simulate the agricultural production fall by assuming an overall 50% decrease in crop yields (production/hectare) during the simulation period, which will reduce Ukraine\u2019s exportable grain and oilseeds surpluses. Scenario 1c adds \u2018Additional trade Cost Ukraine \u2018. Exports are further reduced by assumed additional trade costs of 20% due to infrastructural damages, harbour blockages and high-risk insurance costs of transported goods.2.Impacts in Russia on GDP and agricultural exports. In Scenario 2a \u2018Russian trade sanctions\u2019 are added. The EU, UK, USA, Canada and several other countries have denied Russia access to the international payment system SWIFT and international bank loans. Moreover, Russian banks\u2019 assets are being frozen in the US, UK, EU and Canada54. These financial sanctions will affect the country\u2019s investments, exchange rate and, consequently, imports. In addition, restrictions on technology exports (particularly in the energy, telecom, aerospace, and defence industries) have been imposed by the EU, US and some other countries that have macroeconomic implications. Scenario 2b adds \u2018GDP reduction Russia \u2018following the expectations of various international organisations, we assume Russian GDP to fall by 10%29,30,31 Scenario 2c adds \u2018Export reduction agricultural Russian exports. Russian agricultural production is assumed to be not directly affected by foreign sanctions related to the war with Ukraine, but restrictions on technology imports and services, in addition to financial restrictions and the withdrawal of Western-based multinationals active in the food industries in Russia can affect agricultural productivity. Lower productivity leads to less production and exportable surplus, which can affect international markets for agricultural commodities. In addition, news items in March indicate Russia considers export quota of grains and sunflower oil for 2022 to keep domestic prices stable, yet we do not include Russian banned exports or export restrictions in our simulations. Moreover, there are signs that exports of wheat and oilseeds (meal and oil) face logistic problems and are paralysed due to high insurance risks and international payments restrictions55. We assume these factors will lead to a reduced Russian export of wheat and oilseeds by 50% each.3.Impacts on global energy prices. Since Russia is a key player in the global energy market, the conflict and associated (threats of) sanctions may affect the energy markets substantially. The many market uncertainties make price projections extremely difficult for some fossil fuel price developments in February and March 2022. We assume international energy prices will increase by 20%, caused by the disruption in the relationship with Russia, and the consequences of sanctions on technology exports and financial restrictions, which put pressure on security of supply on the medium-term32. The USA and the UK have announced a ban on importing Russian oil and gas to be implemented by the end of 2022. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas and has not targeted Russian energy exports (yet). Fertiliser prices are affected by energy prices and are endogenously determined by the model projection.Data availabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available from Global Trade Analyses Project (GTAP, https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/default.asp), but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study and so are not publicly available.

EU leaders on Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024, sealed a deal to provide Ukraine with 50 billion euros ($54 million) to shore up its economy ravaged by a nearly two-year-old war with Russia. (AP Photo/Daniel Cole, File)By\u00a0THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\u00a0Share                    Share                    CopyLink copied        Email     FacebookXRedditLinkedInPinterestFlipboard        Print    EU leaders on Thursday sealed a deal to provide Ukraine with 50 billion euros ($54 million) to shore up its war-ravaged economy after Hungary dropped weeks of threats to veto the measure.The aid package \u2014 about two-thirds loans and one-third grants to be paid out over a four-year period \u2014 is not intended to fund arms and ammunition, which fall under a separate EU plan. Instead, it aims to stabilize Ukraine\u2019s economy after nearly two years of fighting, pay for rebuilding, and set the country up for future EU membership.The package will help Kyiv plug budget gaps while avoiding the skyrocketing inflation seen in the first months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine lost a third of its economic output to wartime destruction and occupation by Moscow, which took over the main heavy industry hubs in the east.

The economy rebounded somewhat last year, but Kyiv spends almost all of its tax revenue on the war.As of Saturday, neither President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office nor the Ukrainian finance ministry have disclosed details of how the funds will be spent. However, statements by EU authorities, Ukrainian lawmakers and diplomats have identified key areas of concern:1. Paying state salaries and pensions This means compensation for teachers, doctors, nurses, civil servants and other public-sector employees.2. Ensuring smooth power and water supplies, and keeping other public services running The Ukrainian government needs to maintain domestic support for the war and has tried to shield civilians from disruption, including in the face of mass Russian airstrikes last winter that led to widespread power outages.3. Supporting the currencyBohdan Yeremenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker and former diplomat, told Ukrainian media on Thursday that he expected the government to use some of the funds to ease downward pressure on the hryvnia, saying it was important for macroeconomic stability.4. Safety net for foreign investments in Ukraine Yevheniia Kravchuk, another deputy from Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, told the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle Friday that Kyiv will use some of the aid to provide insurance and stable financing for foreign investments, including plants that produce arms and ammunition.Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, attends a joint press conference with Swiss Federal President Viola Amherd after a meeting in Kehrsatz near Bern, Switzerland, Monday, Jan. 15, 2024.(Alessandro della Valle/Keystone via AP, Pool)Zelenskyy welcomed the assistance, in a post on X, formerly Twitter. He said that continued financial help from the EU would strengthen Ukraine\u2019s long-term economic stability, \u201cwhich is no less important than military assistance and sanctions pressure on Russia.\u201d Russia\u2019s economy, meanwhile, has weathered the unprecedented economic sanctions by Kyiv\u2019s Western allies better than expected, despite a price cap on Russian oil and natural gas and a widespread diversification in the West towards other energy sources.In late November, Moscow adopted its biggest-ever federal budget, with defense spending overtaking social spending for the first time in modern Russian history. Record low unemployment, higher wages and targeted social spending have so far helped the Kremlin ride out the domestic impact of pivoting the economy to a war footing. However, some analysts have called its spending plans \u201cunsustainable in the long term,\u201d saying they expect tax rises after the presidential election in March.

With the aid caught up in domestic politics, the Biden administration on Tuesday came empty-handed for the first time as host of the monthly meeting of about 50 nations that coordinate support for Ukraine. The group was established by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in April 2022. While waiting for Congress to approve more money for Ukraine\u2019s fight, Washington will look to allies to keep bridging the gap. \u201cI urge this group to dig deep to provide Ukraine with more lifesaving ground-based air defense systems and interceptors,\u201d Austin said in opening remarks broadcast from his home, where he is recuperating after prostate cancer surgery.                     RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR                Russian missiles strike Ukrainian cities again, killing at least 7 and wounding dozensSenators are racing to win support for a border deal as aid to Ukraine hangs in the balanceZelenskyy calls Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia \u2018very dangerous\u2019The opening statement by video was the first public appearance from Austin, 70, who appeared slightly gaunt. He was hospitalized for two weeks after complications from the surgery. After the meeting, Celeste Wallander, assistant defense secretary for international affairs, told reporters that Ukraine\u2019s ministry of defense is getting reports from its front lines that \u201cunits are not do not have the stocks and the stores of ammunition that they require.\u201dWallander added, \u201cThat is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress\u2019 questions, so that they are able to move forward on a decision to pass\u201d legislation with the aid.While Ukraine waits to see what Congress will do, European allies are moving ahead with new measures to support Ukraine.In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced a $1.2 billion joint contract to buy more than 222,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition. The rounds are some of the most heavily used munitions in the war, and the contract will be used to backfill allies that have pushed their own reserves to Kyiv. While the conflict between Israel and Hamas has dominated headlines since October, Russia\u2019s onslaught against Ukraine has continued.Russia on Tuesday launched a barrage of more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles into Ukraine\u2019s two biggest cities, damaging apartment buildings and killing at least five people. The assault came a day after Moscow shunned any deal backed by Kyiv and its Western allies to end the almost two-year war.Ukraine\u2019s air defenses were able to intercept at least 21 of the missiles. But the attacks injured at least 20 people in four districts of Kyiv, the capital. The Pentagon announced its last security assistance for Ukraine on Dec. 27, a $250 million package that included 155 mm rounds, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and other high-demand items drawn from existing U.S. stockpiles. The U.S. has not been able to provide additional munitions since then because the money for replenishing those stockpiles has run out and Congress has yet to approve more funds. More than $110 billion in aid for both Ukraine and Israel is stalled over disagreements between Congress and the White House over other policy priorities, including additional security for the U.S.-Mexico border. Senators are trying for a bipartisan deal that would include nearly $61 billion in aid for Ukraine and make changes in border policy. But Republicans are renewing a push to scale back the amount of assistance for Ukraine, targeting money that would go to Ukraine\u2019s civil sector and arguing that European nations could step in to fund those needs.\u201cPersonally speaking, I\u2019d like to see portions pared down,\u201d Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican senator, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think the number is really high and there are a lot of things funded in there.\u201dBut even if a deal can be reached in the Senate, the package faces even more opposition in the House, where many Republicans have voted repeatedly against the Ukrainian war effort.The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $44.2 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in February 2022. About $23.6 billion of that was pulled from existing military stockpiles and almost $19 billion was sent in the form of longer-term military contracts, for items that will take months to procure. So even though funds have run out, some previously purchased weapons will continue to flow in. An additional $1.7 billion has been provided by the U.S. State Department in the form of foreign military financing. The U.S. and approximately 30 international partners are also continuing to train Ukrainian forces, and to date have trained a total of 118,000 Ukrainians at locations around the world, said Col. Marty O\u2019Donnell, spokesman for U.S. Army Europe and Africa. The United States has trained approximately 18,000 of those fighters, including approximately 16,300 soldiers in Germany. About 1,500 additional fighters are currently going through training.\u2014-Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.The Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

APA/Alamy            Ukraine war: why propaganda doesn\u2019t work as well in Belarus as it does in\u00a0Russia          Published: February 9, 2024 11:50am ESTNatasha Lindstaedt, University of EssexAuthor        Natasha Lindstaedt            Professor, Department of Government, University of Essex    Disclosure statementNatasha Lindstaedt does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.PartnersUniversity of Essex provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK.View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp MessengerThough Russia has accidentally bombed one of its own villages, implemented a harsh conscription policy, and already faced 315,000 casualties, Russian support for the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine has not wavered much. Throughout the conflict, levels of support have averaged about 75%.In contrast, Belarusian people are far more wary of being drawn into the conflict. Based on a survey conducted by the thinktank Chatham House in August 2022, only 25% supported Russia\u2019s actions (if it meant not getting directly involved), while a whopping 97% opposed the deployment of Belarusian troops. Additionally, a surprisingly low number of Belarusians (26%) said they would feel negatively if Belarusian soldiers refused to fight or follow orders. Some Belarusians have even become directly involved in the conflict to support Ukraine, such as in May 2023 when Belarusian volunteers tricked the Russians into firing on their own positions in the town of Bakmut. As conducting surveys in authoritarian regimes draws concern that the responses may be biased in favour of the regime, this makes the results in Belarus even more surprising. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s president, Alexander Lukashenko, has allowed Russian troops to pass through his territory to invade Ukraine, and supported Putin\u2019s invasion. Why Belarus is differentFor the most part, the majority of urban Belarusians surveyed want Belarus to distance itself from the war and express neutrality. In contrast to Russians, Belarusian society considers the war senseless and harmful to Belarus.What explains these diverging views? In general, Belarusians are much more war averse than Russians, with very different memories of what they call \u201cthe great patriotic war\u201d (the second world war). Of all of the former Soviet republics, Belarus sustained the most casualties per capita, and since gaining independence in 1991, it aspired for neutrality \u2013 something that was built into its constitution. But this was put into jeopardy from 2020, when Lukashenko was forced to cosy up to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, after protests broke out challenging the Belarus election. Russian propaganda winsBut Russia also lost millions of men to the great patriotic war, so why is Putin so much more effective in convincing Russians to support another conflict, compared with Lukashenko?In stark comparison to Belarus, Russia has developed a successful propaganda machine that is entertaining, confusing and overwhelming. Flooding citizens with information that demonises its opponents is a key component to Russia\u2019s propaganda strategy. Russian propaganda uses a large number of channels and constantly disseminates falsehoods at high volume and speed.  This onslaught of propaganda makes it even harder for its citizens to discern what is false and what is the truth. Indeed, research has demonstrated that receiving similar messages from multiple sources, no matter the veracity, is very persuasive.Russia has been agile in targeting social media, using the popular messaging platform Telegram to create different channels that support pro-Kremlin narratives. In gearing up for the war against Ukraine, Russia promoted the myth that Russia\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war should be a rallying point for the population in the fight against Nazis in Ukraine. Putin repeatedly made claims that were disseminated through various media channels that Ukraine needed to be de-nazified.Protesters on the streets of Minsk, Belarus, in 2020 after the presidential election.Pavel Stasevich/AlamyResearch has suggested that Putin\u2019s propaganda has elicited strong support for a military invasion among Russians, and that the Russian public\u2019s preferences for using military force were easily manipulated. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, state-controlled media outlets promoted claims that Ukraine was developing biological and nuclear weapons, engaging in ethnic cleansing, and using Russian-speaking residents in Ukraine as human shields. Since the invasion, Russia focuses less on the Nazis and more on fighting the west \u2013 promoting the idea that Russia is the underdog.      Read more:      Failed Wagner Group coup leaves Putin humiliated and Belarus dictator Lukashenko more secure \u2013 for nowTo counter information that challenged these views, Russia blocked western social media platforms, labelling them extreme organisations, and a law was passed which could impose a penalty of 15 years in prison for intentionally spreading false information about the war. While Russians have access to alternative news sources and can use VPNs, support for the war can be linked to the effectiveness of Putin\u2019s propaganda, and many Russians genuinely believe the regime\u2019s narratives.In contrast, Belarus has not been as effective in using propaganda to garner support for the conflict, or Lukashenko. A poll in 2020 in the lead-up to the presidential election found that only 3% intended to vote for him (whereas Putin has been polling at over 70% since February 2022). This resulted in authorities banning Belarusians from conducting independent social research.In addition to Lukashenko being unpopular, Belarus\u2019s state media has little credibility with ordinary people. Unofficial media are seen as a better source of information, particularly since Lukashenko mismanaged his messaging during the COVID pandemic.Non-traditional media has been harder for Belarus to regulate, with platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and Telegram accumulating millions of followers and remaining free from state interference. Opposition rallies streamed live in August 2020 drew over 1 million viewers. A channel called Nexta, created by a Belarusian teen in 2015, became a primary source of news distributed through YouTube and Telegram. Belarus has tried to buy up Telegram channels in order to counter anti-regime messages, but has not had a strong presence.In contrast to the Russian media, which has become a weapon in its own right, the Belarusian state media remains a relic of Soviet times. Modern communications are not Lukashenko\u2019s strong suit \u2013 Russian media outlets reported that he does not even own a smartphone. He has not invested much in the state-run media, which remains unsophisticated. The most that the state can do is block and jam outside information \u2013 it has little ability to craft emotionally appealing messaging that resonates with an audience.Though Russia has tried to exercise greater control over Belarus (and Lukashenko has been a willing junior partner), there is little evidence that there will be much buy-in from Belarusian society. It remains resilient and defiant in spite of all the efforts to convince it otherwise.RussiaVladimir PutinBelarusGive me perspectiveUkraine invasion 0222Want to write?

To what extent has the war influenced crude oil prices, and has it altered the long-term dynamics of oil prices? An objective analysis of the effects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on the crude oil market can assist relevant entities in developing both short-term emergency strategies and long-term response plans. This study establishes an analytical framework of the event analysis method based on multiresolution causality testing (EMC). The results of the multiresolution causality testing reveal a significant one-way causality between the Russia\u2013Ukraine war and crude oil prices. Afterward, using the event analysis based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), from October 1, 2021, to August 25, 2022, as the event window, we found that the war and its chain events caused the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices to increase by $37.14, a 52.33% surge, and the Brent crude oil price to rise by $41.49, a 56.33% increase. During the event window, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war can account for 70.72% and 73.62% of the fluctuation in WTI and Brent crude oil prices, respectively. Furthermore, the war amplified oil price volatility and fundamentally altered the trend of crude oil prices. Consequently, this study proposes four recommendations: the establishment of an emergency management mechanism for the oil market, the diversification of oil and gas imports by energy-importing countries, the steady advancement of energy transformation, and the judicious use of financial instruments by enterprises to hedge risks.Similar content being viewed by othersQuantifying nonlinear effects of BRIC and G4 liquidity on oil pricesArticleOpen access13 April 2022Zhiping Zhou & Xuan ZhangOil price regimes and their role in price diversions from market fundamentalsArticle17 February 2020Robert.

Empirical insights from event studyArticleOpen access18 January 2024Olajide O. Oyadeyi, Sodiq Arogundade & Mduduzi BiyaseIntroductionEver since the outbreak of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on February 24, 2022, it has persisted for more than one year. This war and its consequent chain of events have adversely impacted the global economy through several channels, such as the commodity market, stock market, and trade. Notably, the energy market has been hit the hardest. According to the data released by the American Oil and Gas Journal, in 2021, global oil production stood at 4.423 billion tons, and Russia\u2019s oil production accounted for 534 million tons, which amounts to 12% of the worldwide oil production, making it the second-largest oil producer in the world after the United States. The eruption of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war and the subsequent US energy sanctions imposed on Russia have resulted in a significant surge in crude oil prices. On March 7, 2022, the WTI crude oil futures price touched $133.460/barrel, and the Brent crude oil futures price reached $139.130/barrel, the highest price since July 2008. Since then, crude oil prices have remained consistently high, experiencing short-term fluctuations during the Russia\u2013Ukraine negotiations, G7 sanctions, and different attitudes of European and American countries. In addition, the Fed\u2019s interest rate hike and the strengthening of the US dollar have compounded the impact during this period. On March 26, 2022, the Federal Reserve announced the first round of interest rate hikes by 25 basis points, followed by 50 basis points on May 4, and 75 basis points on June 15, July 28, and September 22, respectively. Against the backdrop of the continued strengthening of the US dollar, on September 27, 2022, the WTI crude oil futures price dropped to $76.310/barrel, and the Brent crude oil futures price dropped to $83.650/barrel, returning to the level at the beginning of 2022. Therefore, this study aims to explore three research questions: How much did the Russia\u2013Ukraine war cause the price of crude oil to rise? Does it have the same impact on the crude oil market in America and Europe? How to identify and separate the effects of other events?The event study method has become a standard analytical tool for evaluating the economic or financial impact of specific unexpected events in the economic and financial fields (MacKinlay, 1997). Some literature also uses event study methods to analyze the impact of extreme events (Ji and Guo, 2015; Ma et al., 2021). However, mainstream event analysis methods do not consider the influence of other factors within the event window. In other words, if the existing methods are used to study the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices, other factors will be included, leading to deviation in the measurement. In particular, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of successive interest rate hikes, and the US dollar continued to appreciate throughout the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, which exerted downward pressure on crude oil prices. Consequently, disentangling the net effect of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices presents a significant challenge. In this study, we propose an event analysis method based on multiresolution causality testing (EMC) to isolate the net influence of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on oil prices. Specifically, this study first applies the VMD method to decompose the crude oil price series, GPR series, and US dollar index series, and uses multiresolution causality testing (Sa\u00e2daoui et al., 2022) to determine the causal relationship between GPR and crude oil price, as well as the causal relationship between US dollar index and crude oil price, to separate the overlapping effects of events. Subsequently, the study quantitatively analyzes the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices and assesses whether this war will have a fundamental impact on the long-term trend of crude oil prices. The results showed that there is a significant one-way causal relationship between all IMFs of GPR and crude oil prices, but there is no causal relationship between all IMFs of the US dollar index and crude oil prices. Therefore, within the event window, we can only focus on the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. Through the event analysis method based on VMD decomposition, it was found that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war resulted in a $37.14 increase in WTI crude oil prices, reaching 52.33%, and a $41.49 increase in Brent crude oil prices, reaching 56.33%. At the same time, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war led to short-term drastic fluctuations in crude oil prices and fundamentally changed the long-term trend of crude oil prices. In addition, the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on Brent crude oil prices is more significant than that of WTI crude oil prices, and the price difference between the two has increased. On March 23, 2022, the price difference between Brent and WTI crude oil reached $12.64/barrel.The contributions of this paper are as follows:Firstly, an analytical framework, namely EMC, is proposed to quantitatively study the net impact of extreme events. The impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices has received limited attention in the literature (Vasileiou, 2022). However, it should not be underestimated. An assessment of the short-term fluctuations and long-term operations of oil prices caused by objective wars can assist relevant stakeholders, including governments and enterprises, in formulating appropriate measures to mitigate the economic impact of drastic fluctuations in oil prices. This paper proposes the EMC analytical framework to quantitatively investigate the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on the global crude oil price. Additionally, the study distinguishes between the American and European markets based on the war\u2019s impact on different regions.Secondly, evaluating the impact of extreme events is a topic that has received much attention in the research community. However, there is a prevalent issue in most existing studies, which adopt event analysis methods without distinguishing the impact of additional factors in the event window. This approach results in a deviation in estimating the event\u2019s impact. To address this challenge, this study employs multiresolution causality testing to differentiate and separate the overlapping effects of other significant events in the event window. Specifically, the multiresolution causality testing technique assesses geopolitical risk in the event window and analyzes the causal relationship between the US dollar index and crude oil prices. Sa\u00e2daoui et al. (2022) originally proposed this method to evaluate the causal relationship between geopolitical conflict and international food prices. Notably, we apply this approach for the first time to separating aliased events within the event window, a significant milestone in extreme events research.Thirdly, current event analysis methods for extreme events rely on empirical mode decomposition (EMD). However, the EMD algorithm suffers from imprecise calculation parameter-stopping standards, leading to deviations in the extreme positions of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Additionally, the period of the IMF in the main mode is not entirely consistent with the period of the original sequence (Zhang et al., 2009), resulting in inaccurate event impact measurements. By contrast, variational mode decomposition (VMD) can circumvent these issues. Therefore, this study employs VMD to quantitatively investigate the short-term, medium-term, and long-term impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices and to determine whether the war has caused a fundamental change in the operational principles of oil prices.The following chapters of the article are arranged as follows: The next section is a literature review and exploration of impact channels; After that, the next introduces the research methods of the article, including the EMC analytical framework, VMD decomposition, and multi-resolution causality testing; The penultimate section shows the research results of the paper; The last section is the conclusion and suggestions of the article.Literature reviewSeveral literature pieces have explored the effects of extreme events on the energy market. These extreme events refer to occurrences with severe and medium to long-term impacts on the energy market (Zhang et al., 2009), including wars, the COVID-19 pandemic, and global economic recessions. Some literature types have utilized the geopolitical risk index (GPRI) to examine the impact of wars and geopolitical conflicts on energy prices. Geopolitical risk is considered the primary factor affecting crude oil prices (Khan et al., 2021), leading to adverse effects on oil prices, return, and volatility (Antonakakis et al., 2017; Ivanovski and Hailemariam, 2022; Aloui et al., 2023). Augmenting the forecasting model with GPR can improve the accuracy of oil price forecasts (Liu et al., 2019). Political risks in OPEC countries also significantly influence oil prices, particularly in Middle Eastern countries endowed with ample oil reserves yet plagued by recurrent armed conflicts (Chen et al., 2016; Hao et al., 2022). Nevertheless, extant literature also posits that oil prices will significantly increase when local geopolitical risks exceed a certain threshold (Cheikh and Zaied, 2023).Different types of extreme events have different impacts on the crude oil market. Various literature studies have focused on assessing the influence of different extreme events on the crude oil market. Iglesias and Rivera-Alonso (2022) and Zavadska et al. (2020) have classified extreme events into two categories. The first category comprises events that result in oil supply crises, such as the first Gulf War, the 11 September terrorist attack, and COVID-19, resulting in higher crude oil price volatility. The second category comprises economic, financial, and stock market crises, such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997/98 and the global financial crisis in 2008/09, resulting in longer-lasting crude oil price volatility. Ji and Guo (2015) have considered the impact of extreme weather (hurricanes) and OPEC production announcements based on the above two types of events. They found that the global financial crisis significantly negatively impacts oil price returns. In contrast, the Libyan war and hurricanes have the opposite effect, and the impact of OPEC\u2019s output announcement is inconsistent. Wen et al. (2021) have classified events into natural disasters and artificial events, finding that both types increase the risk of oil prices. Among all-natural disasters, epidemics have the most significant impact. Lu et al. (2022) have assessed the impact of extreme events on oil prices from both the supply and demand sides. On the demand side, the financial crisis has a comprehensive effect on the crude oil market, while wars and OPEC meetings have short-term impacts, and the impact of hurricanes is progressively diminishing.Furthermore, some literature explores the impact channels of extreme events on crude oil prices. Firstly, geopolitical conflicts and epidemics impose supplementary burdens on the global economy, impinging upon oil supply and demand dynamics and augmenting oil price risks. In addition, extreme events can intensify stock market volatility and amplify oil price risks via market-to-market interactions. Meanwhile, extreme events can increase the risk of oil price jumps. Geopolitical conflicts and other analogous occurrences can also precipitate disruptions in oil supply (El Gamal and Jaffe, 2018), indirectly augmenting oil price uncertainty by exerting influence on the geopolitical landscape (Wen et al., 2021). The impact of geopolitical conflicts on crude oil prices mainly includes the following channels: firstly, such conflicts can affect investors\u2019 sentiments and trading decisions, foster speculative activities within the market, evoke transient fluctuations in oil prices, and magnify price volatility (Fang and Shao, 2022). Secondly, geopolitical risks can impact oil prices via inventory dynamics. As an immediate reflection of supply factors, inventory information significantly influences crude oil prices (Jiao et al., 2023). In scenarios where geopolitical conflicts occur during historically low inventory levels, the impact of depleted inventory becomes exacerbated, perpetuating an upward trajectory for oil prices (Zhang et al., 2023). Once again, geopolitical conflicts can disrupt crude oil supply and subsequently impinge upon prices. Crude oil supply operates within a seller oligopoly market, wherein prices largely hinge upon supply levels. Geopolitical conflicts occurring in major oil-producing nations, notably within the Middle East, can profoundly impact crude oil supply, potentially leading to supply disruptions and subsequent price escalations (Liu et al., 2019; El Gamal and Jaffe, 2018). Finally, extreme geopolitical conflicts can influence oil prices by perturbing demand dynamics (Liu et al., 2019). Massive geopolitical conflicts can undermine the global economy, engender economic downturns, decrease crude oil demand, and lower oil prices. This notion of demand encompasses actual demand, financial demand, and liquidity demand (Koch, 2014).Regarding research methods, event analysis is widely employed for investigating extreme events. In particular, Ma et al. (2021) have utilized event analysis to examine the impact of the Russia\u2013Saudi Arabia oil price war and a subsequent armistice on the global oil market during March\u2013April 2020, revealing an asymmetric influence. Likewise, Ji and Guo (2015) have leveraged both event analysis and the AR-GARCH model to scrutinize the effect of four categories of events on world crude oil prices. Moreover, Zhang et al. (2009) have introduced the event analysis method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which has been applied separately to explore the influence of the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraq War in 2003 on crude oil prices. This has offered a practical scheme for quantitatively assessing the impact of extreme events on the crude oil market. Subsequently, Zhang et al. (2009) employed this methodology to analyze the impact of the financial crisis on crude oil prices. Furthermore, other scholars have expanded on this method and have applied it to investigate grain price fluctuations, the natural gas market, exchange rates, and policies (Zhu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Wei et al., 2017; Geng et al., 2016).Zhang et al. (2009) have adopted EMD for signal processing. However, EMD lacks accurate mathematical modeling and theoretical basis and several drawbacks, including sensitivity to noise and boundary effects (Liu et al., 2020). Furthermore, the decomposed sub-signals in EMD are susceptible to modal aliasing. Dragomiretskiy and Zosso (2013) have proposed a novel decomposition technique known as variational mode decomposition (VMD) to address these issues. VMD is a multi-resolution approach for non-recursive and adaptive signal decomposition (Li et al., 2019), which can decompose the original signal into a sequence of sub-signals with specific center frequencies and bounded bandwidth. Compared to EMD, VMD demonstrates faster convergence, higher robustness, more robust theoretical support, more degrees of freedom, and reduced modal mixing effects (Liu et al., 2021). In the literature, the prediction technique based on VMD decomposition has been demonstrated to be superior to that based on EMD (Lahmiri, 2015, 2016; Jianwei et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2022).Overall, there have been some literature studies on the impact of extreme events on the energy market, and event analysis methods are often chosen. However, the existing literature does not consider the influence of other factors within the event window, and the effects of other factors are mixed in the research, resulting in measurement bias, thereby overestimating or underestimating the event\u2019s impact, leading to decision-making errors. Based on this, the article proposes an EMC analysis framework and takes the Russia\u2013Ukraine war as an example to calculate the net impact of extreme events on crude oil prices, which is the first innovation of this article. The second innovation of the paper is the use of multiresolution causal testing to separate the impact of mixed events within the event window. This method can determine the causal relationship between sub-sequences based on sequence decomposition and can help determine the causal relationship between events and other factors and oil prices, thereby helping to isolate the net impact of events on oil prices. The third innovation of this article is the use of VMD decomposition research, which effectively avoids the stopping standard problem of EMD algorithm parameter calculation and makes the decomposition results more reliable. This article effectively measures the net impact of extreme events on crude oil prices, providing a reference paradigm for research on such issues.Methodology formulationEMC analytical frameworkThe price of crude oil exhibits sensitivity to various factors, including the equilibrium relationship between supply and demand, which ultimately determines the long-term trend of oil prices. However, short-term changes in oil prices are primarily influenced by extreme events and monetary factors. The current mainstream event research method does not consider the impact of other factors during the same event period but directly considers the event as the only factor within the analysis window for direct calculation. This approach easily includes other factors, leading to measurement bias. Solving the problem of event mixing and separating the net impact of events is also a difficulty in event research methods. The event analysis method based on EMD decomposition proposed by Zhang et al. (2009) partially removes the influence of small events within the event window through principal mode analysis but cannot remove other factors that may affect the main mode during the same period. Based on this, this article proposes an EMC (Event analysis method based on Multiresolution Causality testing) analysis framework, which separates the net impact of extreme events on changes in crude oil prices based on the causal relationship between events and other factors and oil prices, as shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1: Event analysis method based on Multiresolution Causality testing (EMC) analytical framework.This research framework is used to analyze the short-term net impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices. This framework can also be applied to the short-term net impact of other major crisis events on commodity prices.Full size imageDetermine the interested eventsThe first step is to select the events that need to be studied and determine whether other factors may simultaneously affect the price of crude oil.Determine the data frequency and analysis windowThe determination of data frequency and analysis window is a crucial step in conducting an accurate assessment of an event\u2019s impact. To establish the data frequency, researchers must consider the duration of the event and data availability. The event analysis window consists of an event window and an estimation window, where the former represents the period during which the event occurred and had an impact. The latter is a period when the event has not happened or has no influence. To specify the estimation window, the trading day before the first day of the event window is selected as the final day.However, the time scale of IMF is restricted by the frequency and window size, with the maximum period extracted from the signal limiting to no more than half of the data points (Zhang et al., 2009). Given that extreme events usually last for a short period, high-frequency data with a lengthy analysis window is the most conducive selection to analyze such events comprehensively.VMD decompositionThe third step is to decompose the crude oil price series and related variables selected based on data frequency and analysis window by VMD and obtain IMFs with different center frequencies.Multiresolution causality testThe fourth step is to conduct a multiresolution causality test on the interested events and preliminarily judge whether the events are the causes of crude oil price fluctuations. At the same time, other important factors that may affect the fluctuation of crude oil prices in the same period shall be tested for cause and effect. If there is a significant impact, it needs to be stripped; if there is no significant impact, it can be ignored.Analyze the inherent modeIdentifying the main mode is paramount in the fifth step of the analysis process. The VMD decomposition technique yields IMFs that are indicative of various influencing factors. The sum of one or multiple IMFs can represent the impact of extreme events and is considered the main mode in the analysis (Zhang et al., 2009). Because the noise and long-term trend in the original sequence are eliminated, the main mode can evaluate the oil price fluctuation range and law caused by extreme events in the event window. The correlation coefficient and variance contribution of the IMFs and the original sequence, along with fine-to-coarse reconstruction and statistical tests, are the primary determinants of the main mode.The second task involves assessing the influence of extreme events on other modes. The analysis of the average cycle of IMFs is crucial to determine the specific meaning of each IMF. Subsequently, spectrum analysis, T-test, and other techniques can be employed to ascertain whether extreme events lead to a more significant fluctuation in crude oil prices.Check whether it is a short-term effect or a long-term effectTo judge whether the event has a long-term impact, it takes longer to test the breakpoint of the data to test whether the event has changed the inherent pattern of the trend of crude oil prices.Economic analysisAccording to the results of the first six steps, summarize the short-term, medium-term, and long-term impacts of the incident on crude oil prices and give corresponding economic explanations.Variational mode decomposition (VMD)VMD assumes that any signal f is composed of a series of sub-signals (modes) uj with specific center frequency \u03c9j and limited bandwidth.Different from the concept of IMF proposed by Huang, the VMD algorithm redefines the intrinsic modal function of limited bandwidth with stricter constraints, which is defined as the component modal function of AM and FM, namely:$$u_j\\left( t \\right) = A_j\\left( t \\right){{{\\mathrm{cos}}}}( {\\phi _j\\left( t \\right)} )$$                    (1)                In which Aj(t) is the envelope amplitude of the signal uj(t) and \u03d5j(t) is the instantaneous phase. The components represented by this function also meet the constraints of EMD.Based on classical wiener filtering, VMD obtains the center frequency and bandwidth limitation by solving the variational problem, finds the effective components of each center frequency in the frequency domain, and obtains the modal function.The decomposition process of VMD is the solution process of a variational problem, which mainly includes the following constraints: (1) The sum of the bandwidths of the center frequencies of each modal component should be minimum; (2) The sum of all modal components is equal to the original signal. Namely$$\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\mathop {{\\min }}\\limits_{\\left\\{ {u_j} \\right\\},\\left\\{ {\\omega _j} \\right\\}} \\left\\{ {\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_j {\\left\\| {\\partial _t\\left[ {\\left( {\\delta \\left( t \\right) + \\frac{k}{{\\pi t}}} \\right) \\,*\\, u_j\\left( t \\right)} \\right]{\\rm {e}}^{ - j\\omega _jt}} \\right\\|} _2} \\right\\}} \\\\ {{\\rm {s.t.}}\\mathop {\\sum}\\nolimits_j {u_j} = f} \\end{array}} \\right.$$                    (2)                Compared with EMD, VMD is a more effective signal decomposition method, which avoids the endpoint effect and modal aliasing in EMD decomposition through image continuation.Multiresolution causality testingBased on MRA theory, the time series signal f(t) is decomposed into multiple regular or irregular sequences when MRDA is decomposed. Applying VMD decomposition to MRDA, we can get:$$f\\left(t \\right) = \\mathop {\\sum}\\limits_{j = 1}^{J - 1} {\\widetilde D_{j,t}^{\\left(f \\right)} + \\widetilde S_{J,t}^{\\left(f \\right)}}$$                    (3)                Among them, \\(\\widetilde D_{j,t}^{\\left( f \\right)}\\) and \\(\\widetilde S_{J,t}^{\\left( f \\right)}\\) represent details and smoothing components, respectively. J represents the number of decomposed IMF, and j and t represent scale and frequency dimensions, respectively. Therefore, we can see that MRA allows any integrable square signal to be analyzed in time and scale, which is especially important for non-stationary time series.Let \\({{{\\mathcal{F}}}}_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)}\\) and \\({{{\\mathcal{F}}}}_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}\\) contain the past of \\(\\widetilde D_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)}\\) and \\(\\widetilde D_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}\\) respectively. Then when the following formula holds, f1(t) is the reason of f2(t) on the scale j:$$\\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)},\\, \\cdots ,\\,\\widetilde D_{j,t + h}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}\\left| {\\left( {{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)},\\,{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}} \\right)\\sim \\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)},\\, \\cdots ,\\,\\widetilde D_{j,t + h}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}} \\right|{{{\\mathcal{F}}}}_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}$$                    (4)                where ~ represents the equivalence of distribution. The following assumptions are made on each scale j:H0: \\(\\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)}\\) is not the reason of \\(\\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}\\);H1: \\(\\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)}\\) is the reason of \\(\\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}\\).A P-order bivariate multi-scale vector autoregressive model can test this causal relationship:$$\\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)}} \\\\ {\\widetilde D_{j,t + 1}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}} \\end{array}} \\right) = \\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {a_1^{\\left( j \\right)}} \\\\ {a_2^{\\left( j \\right)}} \\end{array}} \\right) + \\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\phi _{11.1}^{\\left( j \\right)}} & {\\phi _{12.1}^{\\left( j \\right)}} \\\\ {\\phi _{21.1}^{\\left( j \\right)}} & {\\phi _{22.1}^{\\left( j \\right)}} \\end{array}} \\right)\\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\widetilde D_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)}} \\\\ {\\widetilde D_{j,t}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}} \\end{array}} \\right) + \\cdots + \\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\phi _{11.p}^{\\left( j \\right)}} & {\\phi _{12.p}^{\\left( j \\right)}} \\\\ {\\phi _{21.p}^{\\left( j \\right)}} & {\\phi _{22.p}^{\\left( j \\right)}} \\end{array}} \\right)\\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\\widetilde D_{j,t - 1}^{\\left( {f_1} \\right)}} \\\\ {\\widetilde D_{j,t - 1}^{\\left( {f_2} \\right)}} \\end{array}} \\right) + \\left( {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {Z_{1t}} \\\\ {Z_{2t}} \\end{array}} \\right)$$                    (5)                where k\u2009=\u20091, \u2026, N, j\u2009=\u20091, \u2026 J. Z\u2009=\u2009(Z1t, Z2t)T is white noise.If the following original hypothesis is not rejected, f1(t) is the reason of f2(t) on the scale j:$${\\rm {H}}_0:\\phi _{21.1}^{\\left( j \\right)} = \\phi _{21.2}^{\\left( j \\right)} = \\cdots = \\phi _{21.p}^{\\left( j \\right)} = 0$$                    (6)                Vice versa.Then, construct the following F-test statistics:$$F_j\\left( {d_j^{\\left( r \\right)},\\,N - d_j^{\\left( f \\right)} - 1} \\right) = \\frac{{{\\rm {SSE}}_j^{\\left( r \\right)} - {\\rm {SSE}}_j^{\\left( f \\right)}}}{{{\\rm {SSE}}_j^{\\left( f \\right)}}} \\times \\frac{{N - d_j^{\\left( f \\right)} - 1}}{{d_j^{\\left( f \\right)} - d_j^{\\left( r \\right)}}}$$                    (7)                where \\({\\rm {SSE}}_j^{\\left( r \\right)}\\) and \\({\\rm {SSE}}_j^{\\left( f \\right)}\\) are the error sum of squares of reduced and full regression models, respectively. \\(d_j^{\\left( f \\right)}\\) and \\(d_j^{\\left( r \\right)}\\) are degrees of freedom.Estimating the Russia\u2013Ukraine war effect on crude oil price volatilityIdentify research events and analysis windowsThis study focuses on the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices. On February 24, 2022, Russia announced special military action against Ukraine, and the Russia\u2013Ukraine war broke out. The Russia\u2013Ukraine war did not break out suddenly; it has a long history. The Crimean Crisis in 2014 laid a crisis for the war. The crisis in eastern Ukraine from October 2021 to February 2022 finally evolved into the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. Until October 27, the war continued.The general principle for selecting event windows is the starting and ending points of the event. To ensure the robustness of the decomposition results, the estimation window and event window need to be symmetrically distributed. However, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war has not yet ended. Therefore, the selection principle of the event window in this article is to include the critical nodes of the war, including the outbreak of the war, sanctions imposed by the United States and EU countries on Russia, and a cap on Russian oil export prices by the G7 countries. Therefore, the event window is determined to be from February 24, 2022, to October 27, 2022, and the estimated window is from June 24, 2021, to February 23, 2022. The estimation window and the event window are symmetrically distributed. The analysis window is from June 24, 2021, to October 27, 2022, with 350 data points. The event window and estimation window can be adjusted appropriately within the selection principles. To ensure the robustness of the analysis results, the article also selected two event windows for analysis: February 24, 2022\u2013September 22, 2022, and from February 24, 2022, to December 1, 2022. The corresponding estimation windows are from July 29, 2021, to February 23, 2022, and from May 19, 2022 to February 23, 2022. The results are detailed in Appendices B and C.This study utilizes the daily spot prices of WTI and Brent crude oil for research. The trend chart in Fig. 2 highlights the fluctuations in crude oil prices during the analysis window and marks the factors contributing to these changes.Fig. 2: Prices of WTI and Brent crude oil from June 24, 2021 to October 27, 2022.This line chart displays the trend of crude oil prices within the analysis window and indicates the reasons for the significant fluctuations in crude oil prices during this period.Full size imageSpecifically, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war and its consequent chain of events significantly impacted the crude oil market, resulting in sharp price fluctuations. Additionally, the continuous interest rate increase of the Federal Reserve and the sustained strength of the US dollar are identified as further factors influencing the market. In light of these findings, this paper employs the geopolitical risk (GPR) indexFootnote 1 developed by Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) to measure the degree of geopolitical risk and a nominal broad dollar indexFootnote 2 to evaluate the strength of the US dollar. These indicators are employed to judge the causal relationship between the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, the US dollar, and crude oil prices.VMD decompositionVMD decomposition of WTI, Brent crude oil price, GPR index, and US dollar index is carried out, respectively. Each series has 350 data points, and the decomposition level is fixed at 4. The results are shown in Fig. 3. IMF1 and IMF2 are high-frequency sub-signals, IMF3 is medium-frequency sub-signals, and IMF4 is low-frequency sub-signals.Fig. 3: VMD decomposition results of each variable.a VMD decomposition results of WTI and Brent. solid line WTI, dotted line Brent. b VMD decomposition results of GPR index. c VMD decomposition results of the dollar index.Full size imageMultiresolution causality testThis study initially performs a Granger causality test on the original series to assess the causative correlation between the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, the US dollar index, and crude oil prices. Subsequently, the study utilizes the multiresolution causality test approach to examine the decomposed signal IMFs. The outcomes of the analysis are presented in Table 1Footnote 3Table 1 VMD-based multiresolution causality testing between the GPR index, dollar index and WTI, Brent daily crude oil price.Full size tableBased on the findings presented in Table 1, the one-way causal relationship between the GPR index and the WTI and Brent crude oil prices is highly significant, whether using the original series or IMFs. However, no causal relationship exists between the original US dollar index series and the WTI and Brent crude oil prices. Additionally, there is no causal relationship between decomposed sub-series. Subsequently, we conduct further analysis on the IMF4 charts of WTI, Brent, and the US dollar index.As illustrated in Fig. 4, the IMF4 of WTI and Brent has steadily increased since the onset of the Russia\u2013Ukraine War on February 24, 2022. The Federal Reserve has announced multiple rounds of interest rate increases, starting with an initial 25 basis points increase on March 26, 2022, followed by additional increments of 50 basis points on May 4 and 75 basis points on June 15, July 28, and September 22, respectively. Oil is priced in US dollars, and if the US dollar strengthens, oil prices will inevitably fall. Nevertheless, in the third round of interest rate hikes, oil prices began to show a slow downward trend under various factors, indirectly illustrating the severe impact of the Russo-Ukraine war on oil prices. Consequently, during the subsequent event analysis, the impact of the strengthening of the US dollar can be ignored, and the estimated impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on oil prices can be considered a lower limit of the actual impact.Fig. 4: IMF4 trend of WTI, Brent, and dollar index.This figure illustrates no correlation between the IMF4 of WTI, Brent crude oil prices, and the IMF4 of the dollar index. At the same time, the date of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike indicates that the Fed\u2019s multiple rate hikes have not been able to lower crude oil prices. Therefore, the impact of a stronger US dollar can be ignored within the event window.Full size imageAnalyze the inherent modeTo determine the primary mode of a given sequence, the decomposed IMF must undergo statistical testing to compute the average period, correlation coefficient, and variance percentage of each IMF in the original sequence variance. The average period is determined by dividing the total number of points in each IMF by the number of peaks within it. The correlation coefficient measures the degree of correlation between each IMF and the original sequence, while the percentage of variance reflects the contribution of each IMF toward the original sequence. Table 2 presents the IMF statistics for WTI and Brent, indicating no notable difference.Table 2 Measures of IMFs and the residue for the WTI and Brent daily crude oil price.Full size tableObviously, IMF4 is the principal mode of the sequence, exhibiting a correlation coefficient of 0.9301 (WTI) and 0.9277 (Brent), alongside a variance contribution of 71.87% (WTI) and 73.09% (Brent). Conversely, the remaining IMFs display considerably lower correlation coefficients and variance contributions, among which the correlation coefficient of the largest IMF3 is 0.5365 (WTI) and 0.5179 (Brent), accompanied by a variance contribution of 9.92% (WTI) and 10.74% (Brent).The IMF4 is normalized to the [0,1] range and compared with the original series. It is found that the trend of the IMF4 is consistent with the overall trend of the WTI and Brent crude oil prices, as revealed in Fig. 5. Specifically, the IMF4 increased from its low point in July 2021 and reached its peak in June 2022, after which it started to decline. According to Zhang et al. (2009), the difference between the local minimum and the local maximum of the main mode can be used to gauge the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices. In other words, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war caused the WTI crude oil prices to rise by $37.14, an increase of 52.33%, while Brent crude oil prices rose by $41.49, an increase of 56.33%.Fig. 5: Normalization trend of WTI, Brent, and IMF4.Comparing the normalized IMF4 trend with the crude oil price trend, it was found that the two are consistent, indicating that IMF4 can be used as the primary mode of oil price.Full size imageFurthermore, we analyze the high-frequency IMFs. Table 2 indicates that the cycle of IMF1 is roughly one weekFootnote 4, IMF2 is approximately 2 weeks, and IMF3 is around 2 months. This implies that the fluctuation captured by IMF1 lasts only one week, the fluctuation captured by IMF2 lasts two weeks, and the fluctuation captured by IMF3 lasts about 2 months. The price fluctuation captured by IMF1 and IMF2 is <$5.03, while the price fluctuation captured by IMF3 is <$9.76. This implies that the high-frequency fluctuation of crude oil prices during the event window is below $5.03, while the medium-frequency fluctuation is <$9.76.However, the influence of these high-frequency fluctuations tends to zero in the whole event window. We test the sum of ci of IMF from c1 to ci (i\u2009=\u20092, 3, 4) to determine whether its mean value equals 0 (original hypothesis). As shown in Table 3, it can be seen that from c1 to c3, the mean value does not deviate from 0 statistically, and only the mean value of c4 is not equal to 0, which is one of the reasons why IMF4 is used as the main modal analysis.Table 3 T-test of IMF reconstruction of WTI and Brent daily crude oil price.Full size tableAccordingly, the change in IMF4 can be interpreted as the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. Figure 6 illustrates the proportion of price changes attributable to each IMF\u2019s impact on the overall price change. The WTI crude oil price exhibits a 70.72% price change associated with IMF4, while the Brent crude oil price reports a 73.62% change linked to IMF4. Specifically, these results suggest that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war resulted in a 70.72% change in WTI crude oil price and a 73.62% change in Brent crude oil price during the event window.Fig. 6: Price change percentage of IMFs.The Russia\u2013Ukraine war resulted in a 70.72% change in WTI crude oil price and a 73.62% change in Brent crude oil price during the event window.Full size imageSo, does the Russia\u2013Ukraine war amplify the volatility of the crude oil market? To explore this, we employ the Hilbert\u2013Huang transform (HHT) technique, as put forth by Huang et al. (1998), to analyze the instantaneous frequency of the original signal. The obtained instantaneous frequency values are then normalized within the range [0,1]. The analysis results for the event window show higher and denser instantaneous frequency compared to the estimation window. Based on these findings, it can be inferred that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war has indeed amplified the volatility of the crude oil market. This finding is consistent with a previous study by Zhang et al. (2009). The result is presented in Fig. 7.Fig. 7: Normalized instantaneous frequency in the range of [0.5,1].The event window shows a higher and denser instantaneous frequency than the estimation window, which indicates that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war has indeed amplified the volatility of the crude oil market.Full size imageHas the war changed the long-term trend of oil prices?The findings above highlight the short-term influences of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices. To investigate whether this war has caused any long-term changes in the trend of crude oil prices, the current study employs Bai and Perron\u2019s (2003) structural breakpoint test, utilizing the \u201cstrucchang\u201d package in R software. The monthly spot price of Brent crude oil spanning from May 1987 to October 2022 is analyzed. Based on the AIC and BIC criteria, the study identifies seven breakpoints: February 2001, November 2005, May 2008, March 2010, January 2012, March 2016, and March 2022, with the last caused by the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. Consequently, the study demonstrates that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war has significantly impacted the crude oil market, fundamentally altering its long-term trend in oil prices.Economic analysisThrough the above analysis, we can get the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices as follows:(1)The multiresolution causality test indicates a significant one-way causal relationship between all IMFs of GPR and crude oil prices. In contrast, no causal relationship was observed between the US dollar index and crude oil prices. Additionally, the study found a slow downward trend in oil prices after the Federal Reserve\u2019s third round of interest rate increases, suggesting that the impact of a stronger US dollar can be negligible during the event window. However, the study notes that the spread of COVID-19 mutant strains and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike may all contribute to the decline of crude oil prices during the event window. Despite this, the war still led to a substantial rise in crude oil prices, indicating that the analysis method employed in this study provides a lower limit of the war\u2019s impact on crude oil prices, with the actual impact exceeding the measured value.(2)Event analysis reveals that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war and its subsequent events amplified the high-frequency fluctuation of crude oil prices, resulting in an increase of $37.14, or 52.33% (WTI), and $41.49, or 56.33% (Brent). The Russia\u2013Ukraine war accounts for 70.72% of the fluctuation in WTI crude oil prices and 73.62% of the fluctuation in Brent crude oil prices during the event window while also causing a fundamental shift in the long-term trend of crude oil prices.(3)The impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on Brent crude oil prices is more pronounced than its impact on WTI crude oil prices. According to Eurostat data, Europe\u2019s oil demand is approximately 650 million tons, with self-produced oil accounting for about 240 million tons and import demand accounting for ~410 million tons. Oil import dependence is around 63%. Kpler\u2019s monitoring data for 2021 shows that oil imports from Russia amounted to about 120 million tons, representing 29% of the total import volume, and dependence on Russian oil was around 18%. Among these imports, the Netherlands\u2019, Italy\u2019s, and Turkey\u2019s demand for Russian oil accounted for 35%, 24%, and 42% of their total imports, respectively. As a significant energy importer in Europe, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war substantially impacts Europe, increasing Brent crude oil prices by $41.40. Additionally, the war caused the price difference between Brent crude oil and WTI crude oil to increase sharply. On March 23, 2022, the price difference between the two was as high as $12.64 per barrel.(4)The effects of high-frequency IMF fluctuations are transient. For example, during the war, the favorable or unfavorable signals released by the Russia\u2013Ukraine negotiations will cause the price of crude oil to jump or fall quickly. However, such fluctuations dissipate swiftly as the price is adjusted to negate their impact.(5)The primary impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices is reflected in low-frequency IMF fluctuations. The fluctuation cycle within low-frequency IMF aligns with the broader fluctuations observed in crude oil prices. During the analysis window, the increase in crude oil prices was caused by the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. This finding is particularly noteworthy as, prior to the war, crude oil prices had not exhibited any significant upward trends.Conclusion and suggestionsAs the second largest oil producer globally, Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine and its chain of events have significantly impacted the world energy market. Given its importance as a pillar of the global economy, the trend of oil prices has long been a subject of inquiry for both industry and academic circles (He et al., 2012). To quantitatively analyze the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on crude oil prices, this study established an EMC analysis framework. The analysis window was set from June 24, 2021, to October 27, 2022, with the event window from February 24, 2022, to October 27, 2022, and the estimated window from June 24, 2021, to February 23, 2022.Initially, VMD was employed to decompose crude oil prices, the GPR index, and the US dollar index, and a multiresolution causality test was performed. The results showed that all IMFs decomposed by the GPR index had a significant one-way causality with all IMFs decomposed by crude oil price, while there was no causal relationship between the US dollar index and crude oil prices. Accordingly, the impact of the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve could be disregarded in the event analysis, and the lower limit of the oil price increase caused by the Russia\u2013Ukraine war was determined. Afterward, identifying the main mode of crude oil prices and using event analysis, it was found that (1) the Russia\u2013Ukraine war caused at least $37.14 in WTI crude oil prices, an increase of 52.33%, resulting in a $41.49 increase in Brent crude oil prices, an increase of 56.33%. Russia\u2013Ukraine War can explain the 70.72% change in WTI crude oil prices and the 73.62% change in Brent crude oil prices within the event window; (2) As a major importer of energy to Europe, Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine has had a greater impact on Brent crude oil prices than WTI crude oil prices, leading to an increasing price difference between the two; (3) Through instantaneous frequency research, it was found that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war intensified high-frequency fluctuations in crude oil prices; (4) Through breakpoint testing, it was found that the Russia\u2013Ukraine war fundamentally changed the operating trend of oil prices.Given the strategic importance of crude oil and the formation mechanism of prices in a seller\u2019s market, it is apparent that oil prices are highly susceptible to extreme events, particularly geopolitical conflicts in major oil-producing nations. Energy security is challenged (Zhao et al., 2022). Based on our research findings, several policy recommendations are offered: (1) Establish an effective emergency management mechanism. The short-term and long-term impact of extreme events on the energy market has become apparent. The Russia\u2013Ukraine war can increase oil prices by over 50%, reflecting the significant instability of oil prices. Therefore, countries and organizations should collaborate to establish an efficient emergency management mechanism within the oil market to stabilize supply and decrease sharp fluctuations in oil prices (Chen et al., 2016); (2) Energy-importing countries should strive to attain a diversified pattern of oil and gas imports (Ju et al., 2016). As seen during the war between Russia and Ukraine, European countries\u2019 over-reliance on Russian energy imports can lead to an energy supply crisis if the source country is at risk. To mitigate such effects, energy-importing countries must engage in multi-level cooperation with various nations and gradually create an energy cooperation network while establishing a diversified oil and gas import pattern; (3) Enterprises should reasonably use financial instruments to hedge risks. Extreme events can easily lead to an overreaction of oil prices, amplifying the volatility of oil prices. Enterprises should reasonably use financial instruments such as options and futures to hedge against the risk of high production costs caused by fluctuations in raw material prices, mitigate oil price shocks, and achieve safe and effective operations; (4) Renewable energy must be vigorously developed to promote energy transformation steadily. As a nonrenewable energy source and strategic material, the scarcity of crude oil is evident. However, extreme events can easily change the operating trend of oil prices and transmit it to the macroeconomy. Energy transformation will reduce consumption and import dependence on oil and natural gas while mitigating the impact of sharp fluctuations in oil and gas prices on the economy. It will also guarantee national energy security by constructing diversified energy systems and achieving energy independence to the greatest extent.The EMC analysis framework proposed in this study is deemed suitable for gauging the net impact of sudden and transient extreme events, such as wars and geopolitical conflicts, on commodity prices. However, careful consideration should be given when employing this methodology. For events that have a long duration and trigger multiple chain reactions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to delineate multiple event windows and clearly define the research objects. Each event window should be evaluated independently to ensure accurate measurements and analysis.Within the window of analysis for the Russia\u2013Ukraine war, the added influence of the spread of COVID-19 mutant strains and the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hike led to a decline in crude oil prices. Nevertheless, the Russia\u2013Ukraine war still resulted in a significant upsurge in crude oil prices. Thus, the analysis result in this study can obtain only the lower limit of the impact of the war on crude oil prices. Although the causal testing showed negligible impacts of other factors, the actual impact still exceeded the value calculated in this paper. The upcoming research should focus on developing a technique to peel off these factors together and measure the impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. Moreover, it is necessary to more precisely identify the effect of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on each IMF while considering varied driving factors, such as the equilibrium of supply and demand or the price of substitutes. Furthermore, conducting an in-depth assessment of the long-term impact of the Russia\u2013Ukraine war on oil prices is also imperative. These concerns will be the focus of our future research.Data availabilityThe datasets analyzed during the current study are available in the Harvard Dataverse, https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UDPWJY.Noteshttps://www.matteoiacoviello.com/gpr.htm.https://www.investing.com/indices/usdollar-historical-data.This method does not consider the influence of other factors. To prevent endogeneity issues, the article also uses the Granger causality test that considers other factors. The results are detailed in Appendix D.Except for Saturday and Sunday, only five trading days a week exist.ReferencesAloui D, Benkraiem R, Guesmi K, Mzoughi H (2023) Managing natural resource prices in a geopolitical risk environment.

And while the soaring political rhetoric may have sounded good over the last few years, it's very likely that this week, we truly arrived at that turning point.Putin dropped the mask, Congress dropped the ball and the polling in Canada took an alarming turnMurray Brewster  \u00b7 CBC News  \u00b7 Posted: Feb 10, 2024 4:00 AM EST | Last Updated: February 12In this photo taken from video and released by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024, a Russian tank fires a cannon at an undisclosed location in Ukraine. (Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP)Social SharingWe have been warned \u2014 over and over again lately \u2014 that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is an inflection point in history.And while the soaring political rhetoric may have sounded good over the last few years, it's very likely that this week \u2014 after a cascade of events in Kyiv, Moscow, Washington\u00a0and, yes, even\u00a0Ottawa \u2014 we truly arrived at that turning point.We just might not like where it's going.Following the British victory in the war-scorched wasteland of\u00a0El-Alamein in western Egypt in early November 1942 (and the concurrent U.S.-led invasion of North Africa), Winston Churchill stood before an audience at London's Mansion House for the Lord Mayor's Day Luncheon.It was a watershed moment in a war that, up to that point, had been going very badly for western democracies and the\u00a0Soviet Union \u2014 something we tend to forget in the haze of Second World War nostalgia and self-congratulation.Zelenskyy appoints new Ukrainian army chief, displacing popular military leaderHouse of Commons passes new Ukraine free trade deal over Conservative oppositionGrowing number of Conservative voters think Canada gives 'too much support' to Ukraine, poll suggestsChurchill, the\u00a0wartime leader to whom Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is often compared, recognized El-Alamein as an inflection point.\"Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning,\" he told his audience.There may be no better way of describing where we find ourselves today.As it turned out, Churchill was right. There were still a number of major inflection points to follow \u2014 the Battle of Stalingrad and D-Day among them. But the tide had definitely turned.It's hard to walk away from the events of this week without the same vague sense that something critical has changed.There's been a lot to take stock of:\u00a0Zelenskyy\u00a0firing\u00a0his top military commander,\u00a0the spectacular crash of the bundled U.S. military aid package, the solidifying gridlock in the U.S. Congress,\u00a0public opinion polling in Canada that shows a growing number of Conservatives believe Ukraine is getting too much aid \u2014 and finally the propaganda tour de force\u00a0of former Fox News host Tucker Carlson's interview with a rambling Russian President Vladimir Putin.U.S. television host Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Russia on Feb. 6, 2024. (Gavriil Grigorov/Sputnik/Kremlin/Reuters)\"We're at an inflection point,\" said Dominique Arel, chair of Ukrainian studies at the University of Ottawa. \"But I would say the inflection is taking place in [the U.S.] Congress.\"The replacement of long-serving Ukrainian top commander\u00a0Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi\u00a0with the older, Soviet-trained Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi is significant, said Arel, but it pales in comparison with the political machinations in Washington. He said \"it's hard to see a way out\" of the political stalemate in Washington as the U.S. leaves the impression it's on the verge of abandoning Ukraine.The unblocking of 50 billion euros ($54 billion US) in European Union aid was a bright spot \u2014 one\u00a0which Arel said signals that even though we're at a turning point, it doesn't mean we're headed toward catastrophe in the war in Ukraine.\"We're headed toward\u00a0months ... a whole year of uncertainty, and greater, greater suffering,\" he said.\"Not talking about the likelihood of a complete collapse of the front. No, I don't think so. But the stepped-up bombing of cities is a concern.\"In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office, former Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi, right, and newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi hug each other during an awarding ceremony in Kyiv, Ukraine on Friday, Feb. 9, 2024. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office via AP)In a statement Friday, Syrski indicated he intends to take a tougher approach to\u00a0the war and that his immediate goals are to improve the troop rotation at the front lines and harness the power of new technology.Oleksandr Musiienko, the head of the Center for Military and Legal Studies in Kyiv, said the replacement of Zaluzhnyi won't lead to a loss of confidence in the Zelenskyy government within the army.\"Someone could be disappointed about this decision, but I think more soldiers are waiting for reforms in the army,\" Musiienko said. \"In general, I think everything will be okay.\"Musiienko said he and others are watching to see\u00a0who gets appointed to the new top general's team, because that will shape the direction of the war more than the political debate in Ukraine \u2014 where\u00a0polling shows Zaluzhnyi has become a more popular and trusted figure than the president.Canadian\u00a0support for Ukraine begins to slideIn Canada, meanwhile, the Angus Reid Institute released a survey this week that suggested Canadians' support\u00a0for\u00a0aiding\u00a0Ukraine's war effort is weakening \u2014 especially among Conservatives.Nearly a quarter of Canadians believe Canada is offering \"too much support\" to Ukraine in its fight against Russia, up from 13 per cent who were asked the same question\u00a0in May 2022.Among Canadians who voted for the Conservative Party in the last election, the percentage\u00a0who\u00a0say Canada is doing too much to assist Ukraine\u00a0has more than doubled \u2014 from 19 per cent in May 2022 to 43 per cent now.The Angus Reid findings\u00a0mirror\u00a0what's happening in\u00a0U.S.\u00a0politics.\u00a0Recent Pew Center research found 48 per cent of Republican voters believe their country is giving \"too much\" aid to Ukraine.WATCH: MPs vote to pass updated trade deal with Ukraine\u00a0 \u00a0House of Commons votes to pass the updated Canada-Ukraine free trade deal22 days agoDuration 1:32:57The updated Canada-Ukraine free trade deal passed with support from the Liberals, NDP and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Conservative MPs voted against the bill. Power & Politics speaks to Ontario Liberal MP Francesco Sorbara and NDP foreign affairs critic Heather McPherson. Plus, we bring you reaction from the Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce.Arel said\u00a0there's still a very\u00a0important distinction to be made between Canadian and American political opinion. While there's a significant Ukrainian diaspora population in the United States, it doesn't have the same political clout as the Ukrainian community in Canada.Between half a dozen and a dozen ridings in Canada \u2014 mostly in Ontario and Western Canada \u2014\u00a0are competitive and have Ukrainian-Canadian constituencies that can make their\u00a0political weight felt, Arel said.\"So, one would think [in a close election] that's a check to a Conservative Party of Canada going the way of the Republican Party on this geopolitical question,\" he said.Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has faced some pointed questions about Conservatives' support for Ukraine's war effort. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)That\u00a0might\u00a0explain what The Globe and Mail referred to in an opinion piece this week as Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's \"evasive bombast\" when he was asked whether he agreed that Canada is\u00a0providing too much aid to Ukraine.It's not in Poilievre's interest to answer the question, especially given (as the Globe also noted)\u00a0how Carlson, a self-professed admirer of Russia,\u00a0has a devoted following among some Conservatives in Canada.There's been lots of commentary on and dissection of Carlson's interview with Putin already. For Arel and other experts, however,\u00a0one moment in particular stood out in the Russian president's long-winded history lesson.\"First of all,\"\u00a0said Arel,\u00a0\"it wasn't an interview because Putin can't be contradicted.\" But what was really interesting\u00a0for him, he said, was how Putin \"came dangerously close to saying that Germany had the right \u2014 or at least cause \u2014 in invading Poland in 1939.\"The remark, he said,\u00a0left him thinking,\u00a0\"Wow, okay.\"'One step beyond the Soviets'Soviet history and propaganda was always very selective about its Nazi narratives. It often forgot,\u00a0for example,\u00a0that\u00a0prior to the German invasion of 1941, Moscow and Berlin were allies who carved up an independent Poland.\"So [Putin] pretty much said that yesterday and that's going one step \u2014 one step \u2014 beyond the Soviets,\" Arel said. \"Soviet propaganda would never go to that level.\"Another expert \u2014 who perhaps also sensed\u00a0the inflection point and was reacting\u00a0to the shifting political discourse \u2014\u00a0released a report on Friday that underlined in the starkest of terms what a Russian victory in Ukraine would mean.\"The war in Ukraine is primarily a war for control of people, not land,\" wrote Karolina Hird of\u00a0the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.A firefighter carries a man from a damaged residential building after a Russian missile strike in Kyiv, Ukraine on Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2024. (Alex Babenko/AP)\"Russian President Vladimir Putin has invaded Ukraine twice, not mainly because he desires Ukraine's land, but rather because he seeks to control its people. Putin's project, explicitly articulated in the 2021 article he published justifying the 2022 full-scale invasion, is the destruction of Ukraine's distinctive political, social, linguistic\u00a0and religious identity.\"In her report,\u00a0The Kremlin's Occupation Playbook, Hird said that Putin \"seeks to make real his false ideological conviction that Ukrainians are simply confused Russians with an invented identity, language\u00a0and history that a small, Western-backed minority is seeking to impose on the majority of inhabitants.\"Hird pointed down the road to an ending with a \"hypothetical\" Russian victory and offered a warning:\"The Russian war against Ukraine was always a war to eliminate Ukrainian nationhood and thus cannot end until Kyiv itself is made over into a Russian city and all Ukraine a Russian province.\"ABOUT THE AUTHORMurray BrewsterSenior reporter, defence and securityMurray Brewster is senior defence writer for CBC News, based in Ottawa.

More than 100 people were placed in our temporary accommodation centers,\u201d Andrey Chesnokov, head of the Stary Oskol district, some 115 kilometers (71 miles) from Belgorod, wrote on Telegram.Ukrainian attacks on Belgorod on Dec. 30 killed 25 people, officials there said, with rocket and drone attacks continuing throughout this week.Russian soldiers celebrated Orthodox Christmas on the front line with military priests leading prayer services both on Sunday and on Christmas Eve night, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said. Russian President Vladimir Putin was joined by families of military personnel who died in the war in Ukraine at Christmas Eve services at his Novo-Ogaryovo residence, in the western suburbs of Moscow.\u201cMany of our men, our courageous, heroic guys, are warriors of Russia even now, during the holiday \u2014 with arms in hand, they defend the interests of our country,\u201d he said to the attending families, according to the Kremlin\u2019s press service.In his annual Christmas interview, carried by Russian state news agency TASS, Patriarch Kirill, leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, made reference to the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe trials that befall us today ... are not capable of crushing our worldview, which directly includes love for the Motherland and readiness to defend it,\u201d he said, when asked how to reassure Russians in the midst of military and civilian deaths.___Morton contributed from London.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Previous Ukrainian successes at Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson\u00a0encouraged expectations that a new effort, reinforced with new Western equipment and training, might rupture Russian defenses on a larger scale and sever the Russian land bridge to Crimea. If it did, the thinking went, the resulting threat to Crimea might persuade Putin to end the war.\u00a0The results fell far short of such hopes. Although the summer brought some Ukrainian successes (especially against Russian warships in the Black Sea), there was no breakthrough on land. Limited advances were bought at great cost and have now been significantly offset by Russian advances elsewhere on the battlefield. It is now clear that the offensive failed.\u00a0Why? And what does this mean for the future of the Ukraine War and the future of warfare more broadly? Robust answers will require data\u00a0and evidence that are not yet publicly available. But the best answer for now lies in the way the two sides, and especially the Russian defenders, used their available forces. By late spring, the Russians had adopted the kind of deep, prepared defenses that have been very difficult for attackers to break through for more than the last century of combat experience. Breakthrough has been\u2014and still is\u2014possible in land warfare. But this has long required permissive conditions that are now absent in Ukraine: a defender, in this case Russia, whose dispositions are shallow, forward, ill prepared, or logistically unsupported or whose troops are unmotivated and unwilling to defend their positions. That was true of Russian forces in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson in 2022. It is no longer the case.The implications of this for Ukraine are grim. Without an offensive breakthrough, success in land warfare becomes an attrition struggle. A favorable outcome for Ukraine in a war of attrition is not impossible, but it will require its forces to outlast a numerically superior foe in what could become a very long war.\u00a0QUESTIONABLE EXPLANATIONS\u00a0Some blame the United States for Ukraine\u2019s failed offensive. Not all of Kyiv\u2019s requests for assistance were granted. For example, if the United States had provided F-16 fighters, the long-range missiles known as ATACMS, or Abrams tanks sooner and in larger quantity, they argue, Ukraine could have broken through. More and better equipment always helps, so surely the offensive would have made more progress with more advanced weapons.\u00a0But technology is rarely decisive in land warfare, and none of these weapons were likely to transform the 2023 offensive.\u00a0The F-16, for example, is a 46-year-old platform that would not be survivable in Ukraine\u2019s air defense environment. The United States and NATO are replacing it with more advanced F-35 fighter jets precisely because it is too vulnerable. Although the F-16 has been modernized since its introduction in 1978 and it would be an upgrade to Ukraine\u2019s even older and less survivable Soviet-era MIG-29s, a fleet of F-16s would not give Ukraine air superiority in any way that could create a breakthrough on the ground.\u00a0ATACMS missiles would have enabled Ukraine to strike deeper targets, especially in Russian-held Crimea, and this would have reduced the efficiency of the Russian logistical system in particular. But all weapons have countermeasures, and the Russians have already proved adept at countering the GPS guidance that ATACMS uses to hit its targets. The shorter-range HIMARS missile system was highly effective for Ukraine when first introduced to the war in 2022 but is now much less so, in part because the Russians have reduced their reliance on large supply nodes within the weapon\u2019s reach but also because they have learned to jam the GPS signals that both missile systems use for guidance. War-winning weapons are very rare in land warfare.\u00a0American Abrams tanks are far superior to Ukraine\u2019s fleet of mostly Soviet-era T-64s and T-72s. But so are the German Leopard 2 tanks that Ukraine used in the summer offensive. The Leopard 2s performed well but were hardly invulnerable superweapons. Of the fewer than 100 Leopard 2s in Ukrainian service, at least 26 have been knocked out; others cannot be used because of repair and maintenance issues. Like all tanks, the Leopard 2 and Abrams depend on tight combined-arms coordination with infantry, artillery, and engineers at scale to survive on the battlefield, and they require an extensive support infrastructure to sustain themselves in combat. Ukraine proved unable to provide these in 2023. Weakly supported Leopard 2s led the initial summer assaults but made little headway. More such advanced tanks would have helped, but the offensive offers little evidence that better tanks would have been decisive.\u00a0Others trace the problem to a broader military revolution in which new technology is held to be making the battlefield too lethal for successful offensive maneuvers, regardless of F-16 fighters, ATACMS missiles, or Abrams tanks. Drones, satellite surveillance, and precision weapons are the technologies that most military revolution theorists now emphasize. Yet all were present for Ukraine\u2019s offensive successes in 2022 as well as its offensive failure in 2023. And the realized lethality of these new systems in actual use has not been radically greater than that of previous generations of weapons in more than a century of great-power combat experience. The Ukraine war experience shows little evidence of any new age of technologically determined defense dominance.\u00a0Still others emphasize training and strategic decision-making. The brigades that Ukraine committed to the summer offensive were mostly inexperienced formations that received just five weeks of Western training before the operation. By contrast, British infantry in World War II were given 22 weeks of instruction, then further training in their combat units, and were only then committed to combat. Five weeks is not enough time to master the complexities of modern battle. Some U.S. officers also believe that the Ukrainian general staff diluted the country\u2019s combat power by dividing its efforts across three fronts rather than a single axis, leaving the troops on each front too weak to make headway. Between the diffusion of effort and the limited training of key units, in this view, the Ukrainians were left without the ability to use the assets at their disposal effectively.\u00a0INTRINSICALLY DIFFICULTThere is some truth to the training and decision-making arguments. As I argued in a previous Foreign Affairs essay, variations in how forces are used have usually been more important than variations in materiel, so explanations based on force employment have considerable face validity. But these arguments imply that if Ukrainian forces had been better trained and focused, they would have broken through in 2023. Perhaps. But while the Russians have shown little skill or motivation on the offensive, they are now competent defenders. Russian defenses in 2023 were deep, well prepared, fronted by extensive minefields, backed by mobile reserves, and garrisoned by troops who fought hard when attacked. Breakthroughs of defenses like these have historically proven very difficult even for well-trained attackers with a focused main effort.\u00a0The German Wehrmacht of World War II is commonly considered among the modern era\u2019s most proficient armies at the tactical and operational levels of war. Yet the German breakthrough attempt at Kursk in southwestern Russia in 1943 failed when confronted with deep, well-prepared Soviet defenses. Erwin Rommel\u2019s German Afrika Corps failed to break through deep Allied defenses at Tobruk in Libya in 1941 despite its air superiority and a major advantage in tanks, and Rommel failed to break through deep Allied defenses at Alam el Halfa in Egypt in 1942.\u00a0In fact, it has been very rare historically for attackers to break through defenses of this kind. During World War II, Allied armies with air superiority and crushing numerical advantages still failed against such defenses in Operations Epsom, Goodwood, and Market Garden and in the battles of Monte Cassino, the Siegfried Line, and Villers-Bocage in 1944\u201345. Nor did this pattern end in 1945. Iraqi armored offensives became bogged down against even moderately deep Iranian defenses in the siege of Abadan in 1980\u201381, and Iranian offensives failed to penetrate Iraqi defenses in depth at Basra in 1987. More recently, the 1999 battle of Tsorona between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 2006 showed a similar pattern, with mechanized offensives making slow progress when they encountered deep, prepared defenses.\u00a0 Offensive maneuver is not dead. But it has never been easy.\u00a0Offensive breakthroughs do happen. But they typically require a combination of offensive skill and a permissive environment created by shallow, forward defensive deployments or unmotivated or logistically unsupported defenders or both. The German invasion of France in 1940 knocked France out of the war in a month, and the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 advanced to the gates of Moscow in a season, but both offensives were enabled by shallow, ill-prepared defenses that committed too much of their combat power forward where it could be pinned down, away from the point of attack. The American offensive in Operation Cobra in Normandy in 1944 broke through an atypically shallow, forward German defense. The Israeli offensive in the 1967 War broke through Egyptian defenses in the Sinai in less than six days, but this was enabled by poor Egyptian combat preparations and motivation.The American offensive in Operation Desert Storm of 1991 reconquered Kuwait in 100 hours, but this was enabled by fatally flawed Iraqi fighting positions and the limited skills of Iraqi soldiers. Similarly, Ukrainian offensives at Kyiv and Kharkiv in 2022 broke through shallow, overextended Russian defenses, and the Ukrainian offensive at Kherson in 2022 overwhelmed a logistically unsustainable Russian defense that was isolated on the western side of the Dnieper River.\u00a0By 2023, however, the Russians had adapted and deployed a more orthodox defense in depth without the geographical vulnerability that had undermined them at Kherson. And these better-designed defenses were garrisoned by troops who fought. Russia\u2019s poor performance and weak combat motivation in 2022 had led many to expect Russian incompetence or cowardice or both in 2023, but the Russians had learned enough from their failures to present a much tougher target by then. Perhaps an attacker with U.S.-level skills and training could have broken through, as those who emphasize training or operational decision-making tend to imply. But a large advantage in skill and motivation is needed to breach defenses like these. Ukraine did not enjoy this in 2023, and it is unclear whether even American troops would have the skill differential sufficient for a task this difficult.\u00a0QUALITY VERSUS QUANTITY\u00a0The resilience of deep, prepared defenses in modern warfare will make it very hard for Ukraine to achieve a decisive breakthrough any time soon. For more than a century, this has required conditions that seem unlikely for Ukraine at this point. The commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, General Valery Zaluzhnyi, has characterized the war as stalemated but believes that new technology can enable a Ukrainian breakthrough. He\u2019s right on the first point, but probably not the second. War-winning weapons are very rare in land warfare. The difficulty of offensive maneuver in 2023 was not a product of any radical new technology, and it is unlikely that any radical new technology will overturn it. The enemy\u2019s adaptation and the ubiquity of cover and concealment on land limit the ability of new weapons to punch through robust defenses, and Russia\u2019s defenses are now quite robust. Ukraine\u2019s prognosis depends heavily on the future of Western assistance, but even with continued aid, the conflict is likely to remain an attritional war of position for a long time to come, absent a collapse in Russian will to fight or a coup in Moscow. Success for Ukraine will thus require patience for a long, hard war on the part of both Ukraine and its Western allies.\u00a0What does this mean for the future of warfare more broadly? Offensive maneuver is not dead. But it has never been easy. It typically requires both a permissive defender and a well-prepared attacker. This sometimes happens: it did in 1940, 1967, and 1991 and probably will again in some times and places. But it is not easy to create a permissive enemy by fiat. And to exploit a permissive enemy properly requires expensive training, equipment, and officer preparation. The payoff can be great when these conditions combine: Germany conquered France in a month, Israel defeated Egypt in six days, and the United States reconquered Kuwait in 100 hours. But the conditions are not always right.\u00a0This pattern poses a dilemma for the United States. The U.S. military has long privileged quality over quantity. This has produced a military with the skills and equipment to exploit offensive opportunities when they present themselves, as they did in Kuwait in 1991 and may do again in the future. But if the conditions are not right and attrition warfare results, today\u2019s U.S. military is not built to sustain the losses this could produce. The United States suffered fewer than 800 casualties in 1991 and just over 23,000 in 20 years of counterinsurgency in Afghanistan. But in less than two years of warfare in Ukraine, each side has already suffered over 170,000 casualties. The United States has produced about 10,000 Abrams tanks since 1980; in Ukraine, the two sides together have already lost over 2,900 tanks. The United States is starting to ramp up weapon (and especially ammunition) production now. But to produce expensive weapons in the numbers needed to sustain Ukraine-scale losses will be exceptionally costly. And how will the United States replace today\u2019s long-service professional personnel in the face of Ukraine-level casualties?\u00a0If quality can ensure quick, decisive victories, the traditional U.S. approach is sound. But if the lesson of Ukraine\u2019s 2023 offensive, in light of past experience, is that deep and well-prepared defenses remain robust, as they have been for the last century, then quality alone may not be enough to ensure the kind of short wars of quick decisive breakthroughs that U.S. defense planning has long tended to presuppose. Quality is necessary for opportunity but may be insufficient in itself for success. And if so, the United States may need to rethink its balance of quality and quantity in a world where permissive conditions happen sometimes but cannot be guaranteed.Loading...Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.You are reading a free article.Subscribe to Foreign Affairs to get unlimited access.

See here for the latest updates.Ukraine said on Monday it had destroyed a Russian Beriev A-50 spy plane and an Ilyushin Il-22 airborne command post in the Sea of Azov area, dealing a blow to Russian military operations in occupied southern Ukraine.Some Russian military bloggers said the downing of the aircraft would be a huge loss for Russia's air force, since there was a limited number of the planes in service.Over the weekend, Ukraine presented its plan for peace in Switzerland, on the eve of the World Economic Forum \u2014but with Russia absent from the event, little tangible progress was made toward peace.Presenting Ukraine's 10-point \"peace formula\" in Davos to delegates from 83 countries, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Sunday that China needs to be involved in future talks to end the war with Russia.But Russia and its ally China \u2014 seen to be one of the few countries that can influence Moscow \u2014 were not involved in the even co-hosted by Switzerland and Ukraine.Russia previously rebuffed Ukraine's peace plan, which calls for all Russian troops to leave Ukrainian territory, and described previous peace formula talks, to which it was not invited, as \"absurd.\" On Monday, the Kremlin poured cold water on the latest talks, saying peace proposals mean nothing without Moscow's involvement.Mon, Jan 15 202410:14 AM ESTUkraine posts $24.35 billion trade deficit for Jan to NovUkraine posted a trade deficit of $24.35 billion in the first 11 months of 2023, the statistics service said on Monday. Exports of goods totaled $32.98 billion from January to November while imports reached $57,33 billion in the same period, the service said in a statement. -ReutersMon, Jan 15 20249:10 AM ESTEU's eastern members demand import duties on Ukraine grainsThe European Union's eastern states are demanding the EU impose import duties on Ukraine grains, citing unfair competition, Hungary's agricultural ministry said on Monday.The ministry said the farm ministers from Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia had sent a letter to the European Commission requesting the measures, saying cheaper agricultural products from Ukraine are eating into their export markets.The five signatories are among six EU member states that produce significantly more wheat and maize than they need, which is key for European food safety and the EU's strategic sovereignty, the ministers said. \"This is why Brussels needs to introduce measures that protect the markets of member states bordering Ukraine while helping them make use of their full export potential,\" the letter signed by the ministers including Hungary's Farm Minister Istvan Nagy, said. \"One of these [measures] could be introducing import duties on the most sensitive agricultural products.\" Polish protesters block the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing Hrebenne during a strike on December 1, 2023 in Hrebenne, Poland. Global Images Ukraine | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesUkraine's larger farm sizes make the country's grain exports cheaper and that is pushing EU farmers out of their traditional export markets, the ministers said. Farmers in Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia \"have suffered significant damages\" since the EU suspended import quotas and customs on grain from Ukraine last year, they said. The ministers are also calling on the European Commission, the bloc's executive, to examine in a report whether Ukraine's production guidelines are in line with EU standards.The complaints were addressed to EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis and Farm Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski. Grain exports have been a rare source of tension between Kyiv and its EU neighbours as Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia became alternative transit routes for Ukrainian grain to help offset slower exports via Ukraine's Black Sea ports after the Russian invasion in 2022.\u2014\u00a0ReutersMon, Jan 15 20248:59 AM ESTKremlin says it has no information on war planes allegedly downed by UkraineThe Kremlin said Monday it has no information about two Russian war planes that Ukraine claimed to have shot down.Ukraine said on Monday it had destroyed a Russian Beriev A-50 spy plane and an Ilyushin Il-22 airborne command post in the Sea of Azov area.

Russia and Iran have grown closer in recent years, particularly since Russia invaded Ukraine and started procuring Iranian-made drones. Russia has not commented on its drone supply, while Tehran has admitted to supplying drones but said it did so before the war.Russia and Iran have also become more aligned over Middle Eastern affairs, criticizing Israel for its attacks on Palestinian territory and Iran-backed militant group Hamas.Shoigu noted that Moscow and\u00a0Tehran\u00a0are increasing joint efforts \"to create an equal multipolar world,\" the RIA news agency added, saying that both parties had discussed \"issues of military and military-technical cooperation and exchanged views on regional security issues.\"\u2014 Holly EllyattMon, Jan 15 20246:54 AM ESTUkraine says it destroys Russian spy plane and airborne command postMOSCOW, RUSSIA - MAY 9 : Beriev A-50, airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft based on the Ilyushin Il-76 transport, performs during a Victory Day military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in the 1941-1945 Great Patriotic War, the Eastern Front of World War II, amid coronavirus (Covid-19) precautions at Red Square in Moscow, Russia on May 09, 2020.

The A-50, which first came into service near the end of the Soviet era, is a large Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft that can scan an area several hundred kilometres across for enemy aircraft, ships and missiles.Some Russian military bloggers said the downing of the aircraft would be a huge loss for Russia's air force, since there was a limited number of the planes in service.\"It will be another dark day for the Russian Aerospace Forces and Air Defense,\" wrote Rybar, a blogger with nearly 1.2 million subscribers that supports and provides running commentary on Russia's war in Ukraine.\"There are not many A-50s. And the specialists operating them are generally rare. If an aircraft of this type is hit, the crew will not be able to escape.\" It was not clear how many A-50s Russia has in service.\u2014\u00a0ReutersMon, Jan 15 20245:41 AM ESTUkraine House in Davos showcases atrocities of war with TikTok collaborationUkraine House Davos on the promenade at the World Economic Forum.CNBCA photo and video exhibition showcasing the atrocities of war dominates at the Ukraine House in Davos, Switzerland.For the third year running, the pop-up dedicated to the war in Ukraine is attracting attention on the promenade of the World Economic Forum's annual summit.This year, a collaboration with TikTok sees a rolling stream of videos of everyday life in the war-torn country, as captured by Ukrainians and shared under the hashtag #IliveinUA.A photo exhibition at Ukraine House Davos showcases the atrocities of war.CNBC\"This is life today in Ukraine.

Share full articleIn Kyiv.Credit...Laura Boushnak for The New York TimesBy German LopezJan. 5, 2024The war in Ukraine has again entered a new phase. With neither side believing that it can make significant territorial gains, the action has expanded beyond the front lines.Over the past week, Russia has bombed Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and other cities far from the front. The aim is not to gain territory, but to destroy infrastructure and wear down Ukrainians by making their lives harder. By doing so, Russia hopes to undermine the impressive national unity that Ukraine has maintained over the past two years.Ukraine responded with missile attacks on the Russian city of Belgorod. Ukraine has also intensified its use of guerrilla tactics over the past few months. It blew up a train in Russia, used sea drones to attack Russia\u2019s navy in the Black Sea and destroyed infrastructure in the Russian-controlled peninsula of Crimea. Ukraine is trying to demonstrate that it can still make progress, even as it has struggled to retake territory in the largely Russian-controlled Donbas.ImageCredit...By The New York TimesThe attacks are \u201can acknowledgment of the stalemate,\u201d said Stacie Goddard, an international security expert at Wellesley College. \u201cThis is all they can do.\u201dToday\u2019s newsletter explains why these tactics will likely define the war in the coming months.A continued stalemateThe new phase is a response to disappointments that both sides have experienced. Russia failed to take Kyiv and topple Ukraine\u2019s government in the early days of the war, and last year failed to expand its territory by much. It now controls about one-fifth of Ukrainian land, a large portion of which it seized in 2014, rather than during the current war.Ukraine\u2019s disappointments have been more recent. During a much anticipated counteroffensive that began last summer, Ukraine mostly failed to break through Russian lines in the east and southeast. Leaders on both sides have come to recognize that dislodging a dug-in enemy is extremely difficult.Both sides\u2019 militaries are also depleted. Russia\u2019s army is running short on manpower and equipment. To carry out a new offensive, Russian President Vladimir Putin would most likely need to call a new draft, which might be unpopular and weaken public support for the war.Ukraine\u2019s troops are similarly exhausted, and its supplies are running low. Ukrainian battalions report that they have reduced their artillery firing by as much as 90 percent compared with last summer. \u201cThis is perhaps the bleakest time for Ukraine\u2019s military,\u201d my colleague Eric Schmitt, who covers national security, said.Ukrainian officials argue that only more Western support can turn things around.But it is not clear that aid will come. In Europe, far-right parties, which are less supportive of aid, have gained traction. Hungary\u2019s far-right government recently blocked additional E.U. aid for Ukraine, and other countries are now trying to decide whether to offer support through other channels.In the U.S., congressional Republicans have blocked further aid until Democrats agree to changes to immigration policy. And this year\u2019s elections could put Donald Trump, who is skeptical of more aid, in the White House. \u201cFor Putin, the main events will be in Washington,\u201d my colleague Julian Barnes said.ImageUkrainian soldiers in the Donetsk region. Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesThe coming monthsA major question about the near term is whether the two sides will move closer to a peace agreement. Putin seems more open to a cease-fire that would let Russia keep the territory it has now, as The Times reported last month.To that end, Russia seems focused on holding its gains and continuing to bomb Ukrainian cities to damage civilian morale. Russia is unlikely to carry out a big offensive, but it might try to make small advances in the parts of the Donbas that it doesn\u2019t already control.U.S. officials have advised Ukraine to rebuild this year, and not to attempt a new counteroffensive. Still, Ukrainian leaders believe that they need to show progress on the battlefield to shore up Western support. At the least, Ukraine is likely to continue its guerrilla tactics, sabotaging infrastructure deep in Russian territory and hitting Russia\u2019s navy.Wars are unpredictable, and a surprising breakthrough from either side remains possible. But the chances have risen that the next 12 months of war will end up in a stalemate.For more: North Korea is giving Russia ballistic missiles for its war in Ukraine in exchange for Russian fighter jets and other military technology, the White House said.THE LATEST NEWS2024 ElectionRon DeSantis criticized Donald Trump\u2019s abortion stance at a CNN town hall in Iowa, where he made his most forceful attacks yet against the former president.In another town hall broadcast right after, Nikki Haley appeared uncomfortable and on the defensive over a string of recent campaign missteps.In a new ad, Chris Christie said he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d when he endorsed Trump in 2016.Trump has used cajoling phone calls and threats on social media to win Republican endorsements.The head of the Teamsters union, which endorsed President Biden in 2020 but has yet to back a 2024 candidate, met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.MigrationDemocratic leaders in cities thousands of miles from the border want more federal help to deal with migrant inflows.Mayor Eric Adams sued 17 bus companies that he said had helped Texas officials send tens of thousands of migrants to New York City.The number of migrants from Africa crossing the southern border is on the rise, as smuggling networks capitalize on growing restrictions in Europe.In Eagle Pass, Texas, emergency workers are overwhelmed by calls to assist migrants.Representative Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican whose border district includes Eagle Pass, once broke with his party on immigration.

And if (Russian authorities) don\u2019t understand this \u2026 I don\u2019t know. God be their judge,\u201d she told a SOTAvision reporter, struggling to hold back tears.Saturday\u2019s demonstration was the ninth and largest of similar weekly gatherings organized by The Way Home. One popular Russian Telegram news channel estimated that some 200 people turned out. Allies of jailed Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny and Russian opposition politician Maksim Kats voiced support for the protest on Friday, while the Moscow prosecutor\u2019s office early on Saturday warned Russians not to participate in \u201cunauthorized mass events.\u201dAccording to OVD-Info, an independent website that monitors political arrests in Russia, police detained 27 people during the protest, mostly journalists. According to Sota, most were later released, although a male protester, Yaroslav Ryazanov, was still in detention Saturday evening.Aware of the public backlash, the Russian military has since late 2022 increasingly sought to bolster the forces in Ukraine by enlisting more volunteers. The authorities claimed that about 500,000 signed contracts with the Defense Ministry last year.Still, the wives\u2019 and relatives\u2019 calls to bring mobilized reservists home have been stonewalled by Russia\u2019s government-controlled media, and some pro-Kremlin politicians have sought to cast them as Western stooges. Protesters on Saturday angrily rejected the accusation.Maria Andreyeva, whose husband and brother are fighting in Ukraine, told SOTAvision that she saw the fighting in Ukraine as \u201ca great tragedy that happened between two brotherly peoples.\u201d\u201cAlmost every Russian has relatives in Ukraine, close and distant, so\u2026 this is a situation that has struck us to the core. After the Second World War, it seemed to us that our grandfathers died so that there would never be another (conflict),\u201d Andreyeva said.The protest came just weeks before the Russian presidential election, scheduled to take place over three days on March 15-17, that Putin is all but assured to win. After Andreyeva and others laid flowers at the monument, they headed to Putin\u2019s campaign headquarters to present their demands to him.Last month, another Russian presidential hopeful met with Andreyeva and other soldiers\u2019 relatives campaigning for their return. Former local legislator Boris Nadezhdin, who openly opposes the war in Ukraine, criticized the Kremlin\u2019s decision to keep them in the ranks as long as the fighting continues.\u201cWe want (the authorities) to treat people who are doing their duty in a decent way,\u201d Nadezhdin said.

Speaking to Britain\u2019s Channel Four News in an interview that aired Friday, the Ukrainian president described the Republican frontrunner\u2019s boast as \u201cvery dangerous\u201d \u2013 on the grounds that Trump has not said what his post-war scenario would look like.                Zelensky conceded it was possible Trump\u2019s claim was just electioneering, or what he called a \u201cpolitical message.\u201d                But he said the idea that Trump as president might unilaterally make decisions that do not work for Ukraine or its people, and seek to drive them through regardless, \u201cmakes me really quite stressed.\u201d                Trump\u2019s propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy resurfaced in May last year, when he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, \u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.\u201d                Asked how, Trump said he would meet both Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, telling Collins, \u201cThey both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, that war will be over.\u201d                Zelensky has generally stayed away from criticizing Trump, preferring not to lean-in too heavily to the split between Democrats and Trump-supporting Republicans, who have effectively put a block on further US funding for Kyiv.

It is widely believed that a Trump victory in November is something Putin would welcome, giving him the opportunity, at a minimum, to hold onto his territorial gains in Ukraine and declare a victory.                By contrast, Zelensky continues to insist there can be no peace deal that does not see the removal of all Russian forces from lands they have captured from Ukraine since 2014, including Crimea.

Even so, the Biden administration, and the NATO alliance, have repeatedly stressed Ukraine will not be coerced into any agreement with Russia, summed up in the phrase: \u201cNothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine.\u201d                Offered the chance in the Channel Four News interview to invite Trump to Ukraine, Zelensky did not hesitate.                Turning to address the camera, he said, \u201cPlease, Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be [reason] enough to come.\u201d                \u201cMaybe Donald Trump really has some idea, a real idea, and he can share it with me,\u201d Zelensky added, returning to face the interviewer.

Thompson             January 16, 2024 2:12 pm (EST)          EmailPrint      A Ukrainian serviceman releases a drone near Bakhmut, Ukraine.              Inna Varenytsia/ReutersArticleCurrent political and economic issues succinctly explained.From drones that fit in the palm of the hand to drones weighing more than 1,000 pounds (454 kilograms), Ukraine has built and acquired a diverse fleet of remotely piloted aircraft to complicate and frustrate Russia\u2019s advances. The constantly evolving scope of this technology and its ever-growing use signal not only the potential for drones to level the playing field in the Russia-Ukraine war, but also their ability to influence how future conflicts are waged.Why is the war in Ukraine a hotbed for drones?As the war enters its third calendar year, neither side is close to achieving air superiority. Most military analysts expected that Russia, with its superior air power, would quickly seize control of contested airspace early in the conflict. But surprisingly, Ukraine\u2019s defenses, later bolstered by Western systems, were able to repel and deter Russian aircraft from making near-border and cross-border strikes. The inability of either side to break through the other\u2019s integrated air defenses has forced them to increase the agility of their fielded forces and rely more heavily on standoff weapons, including long-range artillery, missiles, and drones. These conditions have led to the development of new drone technologies that could help Ukraine level the playing field in the air battle and possibly turn the tide of the war in its favor.What technologies are in use?More on:UkraineRussiaMilitary OperationsDefense TechnologyUkraine\u2019s drone deployment has evolved with the changing battlefield. During earlier stages of the war\u2014when Russia\u2019s air defense and electronic-warfare capabilities were less pronounced\u2014Ukraine relied on larger drones such as the Turkish TB2 Bayraktar to great effect. The TB2\u2019s ability to carry multiple air-to-ground munitions and loiter for long periods allowed Ukrainian forces to penetrate Russian air defenses and strike heavy targets. However, as time progressed and Russia took greater control of the skies, it was able to detect and shoot down these larger models more easily. The TB2 may maintain some relevance\u2014its sensor suite and considerable range still enable Ukrainian operators to collect intelligence\u2014but Ukraine has nonetheless shifted to using smaller drone technology to adapt to Russian advances.The World This WeekA weekly digest of the latest\u00a0from CFR on the biggest foreign policy stories of the week, featuring briefs, opinions, and explainers.

The Ukrainians have tapped into commercial technology\u2014the same recreational products available to civilians\u2014to get cheap, off-the-shelf drones onto the battlefield quickly. Many of these \u201chobbyist\u201d drones have been acquired through grassroots crowdfunding efforts, or \u201cdronations.\u201d At just one thousand dollars per unit, the small drones can be rapidly amassed and repurposed by operators for a specific effect. For example, the popular first-person view (FPV) drones commonly used for racing or filmmaking are retrofitted with makeshift explosives and flown to strike fixed targets at relatively low cost. These drones can carry out single-use strikes with high precision while remaining less susceptible to Russian air defense systems. Additionally, the Ukrainians have repurposed significant aspects of their domestic economy to support the new drone supply chain, increasing their drone-making capabilities through public-private partnerships. One year ago, Ukraine had seven domestic drone manufacturers and it now has at least eighty.As for Russian drone technology, Moscow deploys indigenous models, such as the Orion, Eleron-3, Orlan-10, and Lancet, but Western sanctions on crucial Russian supply chains have prevented Moscow from excelling in drone production. Instead, Russia has turned to Iran for a steady supply. The Russians now boast an extensive fleet of Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones that can carry 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms) of explosives over a range of 1,200 miles (1931 kilometers).How are drones shaping the war?This conflict has demonstrated the battlefield advantages of drones, which have become smaller, more lethal, easier to operate, and available to almost anyone. They compress the so-called kill chain, shortening the time from when a target is detected to when it is destroyed, and they can bolster a military\u2019s ability to reconnoiter the forward edge of the battlefield. Drones with longer endurance profiles can effectively conduct hours of reconnaissance, enabling other, more advanced drones to carry out precision strikes deep inside enemy territory. Other models enable individual soldiers to monitor adversary movement without risking lives or giving up the soldier\u2019s position.Drones can also play an important international humanitarian role, for instance, by conducting battle and collateral damage assessments or exposing war crimes. U.S. drone manufacturer Skydio recently donated nine drones that\u2014with their high-resolution cameras\u2014will be used to help Ukraine document potential Russian war crimes. Through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), images captured will be used to aid the Office of the Prosecutor General in documenting many instances of human rights abuses.More on:UkraineRussiaMilitary OperationsDefense TechnologyWhat are the defenses against drones?Drones are susceptible to air defenses. Larger drones with a distinct radar cross-section are easy, slow-moving targets for air defense interceptors and anti-drone guns; both Ukraine and Russia have downed thousands of drones with their interceptors and artillery. However, the continual use of these systems by both Ukraine and Russia can be prohibitively costly, as a single drone could cost thousands or even millions of dollars to intercept.An emerging challenge of counter-drone defense is the need to develop and employ a system that is cheaper than its target. Crucially, smaller drones that can swarm toward a target are more difficult to shoot down. as they can overwhelm air defense systems. A key countermeasure has been to utilize electronic warfare in the form of jammers, spoofers, and high-energy lasers that prevent drones from reaching their target. Jammers\u2014used by both Russia and Ukraine\u2014send out powerful electromagnetic signals that can cause a target drone to fall to the ground, veer off course, or turn around and attack its operator. As the war progresses, both sides are continually investing in and adapting electronic warfare tactics to counter the innovations of their adversary.How will the drone war evolve?The Russia-Ukraine conflict has demonstrated that innovations in drone technology can change the balance of power in the air defense domain especially. While Russia seeks to build pockets of air superiority and bolster its drone production and anti-drone defenses, Ukraine continues to develop both more and less sophisticated solutions. In a recently uncovered partnership project with Iran, Russia finished constructing a drone factory in Tatarstan, 500 miles (805 kilometers) east of Moscow, where it could produce an estimated six thousand Shahed-136 prototypes (renamed the Geran-2 by Moscow) by mid-2025. This expanded drone production could be enough to counter Russia\u2019s shortage of drones on the front lines and turn the tide of the conflict in its favor. However, Ukraine\u2019s ability to acquire and crowdsource commercial drone technology, tactically modify drones in the field based on real-time feedback, and alter tactics to defeat anti-drone systems have proved to be crucial to its war effort. Even while overmatched force-wise, Ukraine has shown how savvy technological adaptation can change twenty-first century warfare and could tip the balance of power in favor of the force that is more innovative.Editor\u2019s Note: Opinions, conclusions, and recommendations expressed or implied within are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of the Air University, the United States Air Force, the Department of Defense, or any other U.S. government agency.Creative Commons      Creative Commons: Some rights reserved.

Her husband gave her a warning before he went back to the front: \"Don't panic if you don't hear any news, the connection is often poor.\" That evening in late July 2022, 41-year-old Iryna Bondariva tried not to panic when she couldn't reach him. The next day, two men in military uniform showed up at her home in Odesa, in southern Ukraine, saying \"Open the door, we need to talk.\" \"Why?\" the mother asked. The visitors pulled out a small piece of paper with an official stamp and read it aloud to her: \"It pains us to inform you, with this document, that Vitaly Bondariva died in combat on July 31, 2022, near the town of Mykolaiv. This document will enable you to begin the process of obtaining a pension and the benefits provided by Ukrainian law.\" Physically overwhelmed, the soldier's wife passed out. Since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24, 2022, more than 70,000 Ukrainian servicemen have been killed at the front, according to US estimates \u2013 Ukraine does not disclose the death toll. Many have left behind wives and children. Bondariva is one of the thousands of women who found themselves widowed overnight. Two years after the start of the large-scale Russian offensive, they form an invisible people, whose mourning is compounded by a succession of obstacles. Their ordeal begins with the announcement of death and continues with the ordeal of identifying the body \u2013 provided that the soldier has not been reported missing. In Odesa, around 20 women demonstrate every week to remind people that they are waiting for news of their husbands, missing since March and May 2022, when two military boats were hit by Russian missiles. \"The authorities have forgotten about them, and the majority of people don't even know this problem exists,\" lamented Tetiana Lanovaya 36, a poster with photos of the missing in her hands. \"We want them to help us find them,\" continued Timenko, who has had no news of her partner for over a year and a half. They're all clinging to the hope that they were taken as prisoners of war.    Iryna Bondariva, 41, and her daughter Dasha, 19, at home.

His wife went to the morgue to identify him. The officers presented her with the remains of the man she had loved for 18 years, a \"wonderful husband, very humane, calm, with a sense of humor.\" A missile had struck Volodymyr during a meeting with senior commanders of his brigade. \"His body was destroyed. He had a big hole in his head,\" recalled Bondarenko. In the bedroom, a large portrait of her husband in uniform hangs over the ironing board. Another rests on the bedside table. \"I say good morning to him every morning,\" said Bondariva. \"When our daughter, who's a student, has exams, I ask him to support us.\" Returned after his death, her husband's military jacket still hangs on the coat rack in the entrance hall. \"I don't have the strength to take it off. And I feel it's protecting us.\" You have 72.2% of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only.       Lecture du Monde en cours sur un autre appareil.

Sanger and Steven ErlangerReporting from MunichFeb. 18, 2024As the leaders of the West gathered in Munich over the past three days, President Vladimir V. Putin had a message for them: Nothing they\u2019ve done so far \u2014 sanctions, condemnation, attempted containment \u2014 would alter his intentions to disrupt the current world order.Russia made its first major gain in Ukraine in nearly a year, taking the ruined city of Avdiivka, at huge human cost to both sides, the bodies littered along the roads a warning, perhaps, of a new course in the two-year-old war. Aleksei A. Navalny\u2019s suspicious death in a remote Arctic prison made ever clearer that Mr. Putin will tolerate no dissent as elections approach.And the American discovery, disclosed in recent days, that Mr. Putin may be planning to place a nuclear weapon in space \u2014 a bomb designed to wipe out the connective tissue of global communications if Mr. Putin is pushed too far \u2014 was a potent reminder of his capacity to strike back at his adversaries with the asymmetric weapons that remain a key source of his power.In Munich, the mood was both anxious and unmoored, as leaders faced confrontations they had not anticipated. Warnings about Mr. Putin\u2019s possible next moves were mixed with Europe\u2019s growing worries that it could soon be abandoned by the United States, the one power that has been at the core of its defense strategy for 75 years.Barely an hour went by at the Munich Security Conference in which the conversation did not turn to the question of whether Congress would fail to find a way to fund new arms for Ukraine, and if so, how long the Ukrainians could hold out. And while Donald Trump\u2019s name was rarely mentioned, the prospect of whether he would make good on his threats to pull out of NATO and let Russia \u201cdo whatever the hell they want\u201d with allies he judged insufficient hung over much of the dialogue.Yet European leaders seemed to also sense how slowly they had reacted to the new realities. European plans to rebuild their own forces for a new era of confrontation were moving in the right direction, leader after leader insisted, but then they added it would take five years or more \u2014 time they may not have if Russia overwhelms Ukraine and Mr. Trump undermines the alliance.The dourness of the mood contrasted sharply with just a year ago, when many of the same participants \u2014 intelligence chiefs and diplomats, oligarchs and analysts \u2014 thought Russia might be on the verge of strategic defeat in Ukraine. There was talk of how many months it might take to drive the Russians back to the borders that existed before their invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Now that optimism appeared premature at best, faintly delusional at worst.Nikolai Denkov, the prime minister of Bulgaria, argued that Europeans should draw three lessons from the cascade of troubles. The war in Ukraine was not just about gray zones between Europe and Russia, he argued, but \u201cwhether the democratic world we value can be beaten, and this is now well understood in Europe.\u201dSecond, European nations have realized that they must combine their forces in military, not just economic endeavors, to build up their own deterrence, he said. And third, they needed to separate Ukraine\u2019s urgent needs for ammunition and air defense from longer-term strategic goals.But given the imperialist rhetoric of Russia\u2019s leaders, Mr. Denkov said, \u201clong term in this case means three to five and maximum 10 years \u2014 it is really urgent.\u201dImageChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during the Munich Security Conference in 2007.Credit...Joerg Koch/DDP, via Getty ImagesAmerican officials reached for the familiar assurance that Washington\u2019s leadership and commitment remained unchanged. But they could not describe a plan of action for Ukraine when Congress was still holding up funds for arms, and they struggled to explain how they would achieve a sustainable peace after the war in Gaza.In the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, the conference stage where Mr. Putin warned in 2007 that NATO\u2019s eastern expansion was a threat to Russia, Mr. Navalny\u2019s widow made an emotional appearance on Friday hours after her husband\u2019s death, reminding attendees that Mr. Putin would \u201cbear responsibility\u201d for it.But there was little discussion of what the West could do \u2014 almost every available sanction has been imposed, and it was unclear if the United States and the Europeans would be prompted to seize the $300 billion or so in assets that Russia unwisely left abroad before the invasion. When a senior American official was asked how the United States would make good on Mr. Biden\u2019s 2021 pledge of \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for Russia if Mr. Navalny died in prison \u2014 a statement made in Mr. Putin\u2019s presence at a meeting in Geneva \u2014 the official shrugged.Some attendees found the commitments made by the leaders who showed up uninspiring, said Nathalie Tocci, director of Italy\u2019s Institute of International Affairs. \u201cKamala Harris empty, Scholz mushy, Zelensky tired,\u201d she said of the American vice president, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cLots of words, no concrete commitments.\u201d\u201cI feel underwhelmed and somewhat disappointed\u201d by the debate here, said Steven E. Sokol, president of the American Council on Germany. \u201cThere was a lack of urgency and a lack of clarity about the path forward, and I did not see a strong show of European solidarity.\u201d He and others noted that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, did not attend.Most striking in the conversations about Russia was a widespread acknowledgment that Europe\u2019s military modernization plans, first announced nearly two decades ago, were moving far too slowly to match the threat that Russia now poses.ImageVice President Kamala Harris and Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany at the security conference on Saturday.Credit...Pool photo by Sven Hoppe\u201cEuropean defense was a possibility before, but now it\u2019s a necessity,\u201d said Claudio Graziano, a retired general from Italy and former chairman of the European Union Military Committee. But saying the right words is not the same as doing what they demand.Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, together with a series of defense and intelligence officials, referred repeatedly to recent intelligence conclusions that in three to five years Mr. Putin might attempt to test NATO\u2019s credibility by attacking one of the countries on Russia\u2019s borders, most probably a small Baltic nation.But the warning did not appear to generate a very urgent discussion of how to prepare for that possibility. The conference celebrated the fact that now two-thirds of the alliance members have met the goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense \u2014 up from just a handful of nations 10 years ago. But a few acknowledged that goal is now badly outdated, and they talked immediately about the political barriers to spending more.Even Mr. Stoltenberg warned that Europe remained dependent on the United States and its nuclear umbrella, and that other NATO countries would be unable to plug the gap if the United States continued to withhold military aid for Ukraine.But the prospect of less American commitment to NATO, as the United States turned to other challenges from China or in the Middle East, was concentrating minds.\u201cWe have to achieve more\u201d in Europe, Boris Pistorius, the German defense minister, told the conference. But when pressed whether his country\u2019s military spending should be closer to 4 percent of German economic output, he was reluctant to commit, given that this is the first year in decades that Berlin will spend the NATO goal of 2 percent on the military.\u201cWe might reach 3 percent or maybe even 3.5 percent,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIt depends on what is happening in the world.\u201d When his boss, Mr. Scholz, took the stage, he said that \u201cEuropeans need to do much more for our security, now and in the future,\u2019\u2019 but he stayed away from specifics. He said he was \u201curgently campaigning\u201d in other European capitals to boost military spending.But the fundamental disconnect was still on display: When Europeans thought Russia would integrate into European institutions, they stopped planning and spending for the possibility they might be wrong. And when Russia\u2019s attitude changed, they underreacted.ImageGerman\u2019s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, addressing a news conference in Munich on Friday.Credit...Tobias Schwarz/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\u201cThis is 30 years of underinvestment coming home,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a French defense analyst, who called them \u201cles trente paresseuses\u201d \u2014 the 30 lazy years of post Cold-War peace dividends, in contrast to the 30 glorious years that followed World War II.Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, said that Europe must boost its defenses \u201cbecause what really provokes an aggressor is weakness.\u201d Then, Mr. Putin might risk attacking a country like hers in an attempt to fracture NATO. \u201cBut if we do more for our defense, it will act as a deterrent. People around Putin would say that, you know, you can\u2019t win. Don\u2019t take this up.\u201dWhat was important for Europeans to remember was that this hot war in Ukraine was close and could spread quickly, Ms. Kallas said. \u201cSo if you think that you are far away, you\u2019re not far away. It can go very, very fast.\u201dDmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister of embattled Ukraine, was blunter. \u201cI think our friends and partners were too late in waking up their own defense industries,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will pay with our lives throughout 2024 to give your defense industries time to ramp up production.\u201dA correction was made on\u00a0Feb. 19, 2024:\u00a0An earlier version of this article misstated the day on which the widow of Aleksei A.

It has helped ordinary people keep paying rent, put food on the table and resist Russia\u2019s efforts to break their society\u2019s spirit.The issue was on the minds of U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy when they met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday.\u201cWe\u2019re determined to sustain our support\u201d for Ukraine, Blinken said, \u201cwe\u2019re working very closely with Congress in order to do that. I know our European colleagues are doing the same thing.\u201dHere are key things to know about Ukraine\u2019s economy and why funding from allies is crucial:HOW IS UKRAINE\u2019S ECONOMY DOING?The International Monetary Fund has said Ukraine\u2019s economy has showed \" remarkable resilience.\u201d The first months of the war in 2022 saw the country lose a third of its economic output to occupation and destruction because Russia controls the heartland of Ukraine\u2019s heavy industry.                     RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR                Russia\u2019s intense attacks on Ukraine has sharply increased civilian casualties in December, UN saysBiden invites congressional leaders to White House during difficult talks on Ukraine aidSlovakia\u2019s leader voices support for Hungary\u2019s Orb\u00e1n in EU negotiations on funding for UkraineInflation also soared to a whopping 26% because the central bank had to print money to cover yawning budget gaps.However, things rebounded last year, with inflation falling to 5.7% and the economy growing 4.9% \u2014 more than some major economies like Germany. Ukraine\u2019s banking system has kept functioning, schools and health clinics are open, and pensions are being paid. That\u2019s a lifeline for people like Nadiia Astreiko and her 93-year-old mother, who live on their combined pensions of $170 a month. \u201cThe war has changed everyone\u2019s life,\u201d said Astreiko, 63. \u201cIn terms of money, it\u2019s also hard because now I have to count every penny. ... It\u2019s very hard for us.\u201dWHY DOES UKRAINE NEED FINANCIAL HELP? Ukraine spends almost all the money it brings in through taxes to fund the war. That leaves a huge deficit because there are other bills to keep society functioning, like old-age pensions and salaries for teachers, doctors, nurses and state employees. At the beginning of the war, Ukraine resorted to having the central bank print new money, a dangerous stopgap because it can fuel inflation and destroy the value of the country\u2019s hryvnia currency. As donor contributions became more regular and predictable, Ukraine was able to halt the practice, and the budget passed by parliament in November does not rely on it. One key accomplishment was adjusting old-age pensions, which can be about the equivalent of $100 per month, to compensate for inflation, said Hlib Vyshlinsky, executive director of the Center for Economic Strategy, a policy institution in Kyiv.Printing money again and the resulting inflation \u201cwould bring a lot of people into real poverty,\u201d he said.To avoid that again, Ukraine needs \u201ca decision by the start of February, and the money by the beginning of March,\u201d Vyshlinsky said. WHAT\u2019S THE IMPACT ON ORDINARY PEOPLE?Ukraine is significantly poorer than the rest of Europe. Millions of people are like Astreiko and her mother, with 80% of their money covering food and the rest going to buy medicines for Astreiko\u2019s mother. The only way to afford things like clothes or shoes is to skimp on food and medicine.The pair eat fish twice a week, and meat once or twice a week. For vegetables, mushrooms and fruit, Astreiko grows them herself or picks them in the forest and cans or freezes them for winter.She insists there are bigger worries than the economy \u2014 soldiers are dying and frequent missile strikes hit Kyiv, where her grandchildren live. \u201cWe will survive. If only the war would end,\u201d Astreiko said. The economic rebound has helped sustain businesses like Dmytro Felixov\u2019s concert.ua website, one of the most widely used in Ukraine for purchasing tickets to plays, concerts and comedy shows. He\u2019s been through more than one crisis, including Russia\u2019s 2014 seizure of the Crimea Peninsula. He says the war has led to a \u201ccertain cultural renaissance\u201d and sparked heightened interest in Ukrainian culture. He envisions a return to prewar profit levels around 2025, saying, \u201cOur business will survive.\u201d Even the frequent missile attacks no longer significantly affect Felixov\u2019s business. During a record number of missile and drone attacks by Russia on Dec. 29, ticket sales dipped by 20%, only to rebound to normal levels the following day, he said.If before people went to performances for relaxation, now they help people decompress, he said: \u201cThey go to concerts to heal.\u201dWHERE DO THINGS STAND NOW?Ukraine\u2019s budget this year calls for $41 billion in donor money to close the deficit and avoid printing money. Ukraine is counting on $8.5 billion from the U.S. and $18 billion from the EU, but that\u2019s still uncertain. EU leaders in December failed to agree on a four-year, $52 billion package of assistance. Hungary blocked the agreement, which requires unanimity from all 27 EU members. The bloc is working, however, to find a way for the remaining 26 countries to come up with the money ahead of a leaders\u2019 summit on Feb. 1. Less certain is the situation in Washington, where congressional Republicans have tied money for Ukraine to border security measures aimed at preventing illegal entry by migrants. There\u2019s no decision yet. The White House in October asked Congress for $11.8 billion to provide 12 months of budget support. The money would \u201censure that Putin does not succeed in collapsing the Ukrainian economy,\u201d Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda D. Young wrote in an Oct. 20 letter to Congress.Zelenskyy said Tuesday in Davos that he believed it was \u201ca matter of weeks\u201d until the EU and U.S. come through with more aid.The IMF has played a key role in rallying support, approving a $15.6 billion, four-year loan program for Ukraine. That money leveraged $115 billion more from other donors because it imposes conditions to ensure good economic policy and requires Ukraine to improve its legal and tax systems and fight corruption.There\u2019s a debate about seizing some $300 billion in Russian assets held abroad that have been frozen by governments supporting Ukraine. That money could, in theory, relieve the logjams over taxpayer money in Washington and Brussels \u2014 but faces concerns about the legal precedent and economic impact of such a drastic step.___McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.HANNA ARHIROVA                Arhirova is an Associated Press reporter covering Ukraine.
